  (Auto to Stick)</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">------------------</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Len,<BR>
Do I remember correctly that you converted your car to a manual
transmission? If not, you can stop reading.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">A friend, John Wallace, found two 115
240Ds with manual transmission and we are stripping them, planning
to convert his 240D and my 300D (both 115s) to manuals. While
perusing MB manuals and before disabling working cars, we have
a question on mating clutch/transmission to engines configured
for automatic. I understand there is some piece that must be changed.
What, exactly, is not clear from the manuals-- maybe it's there
and I missed it. Must we change flywheels or crank- shafts (neither
an option for my 300D--with the parts available) or is it a part
bolted (press fit?) on end of crank we must change?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">We are carefully removing pedal assemblies,
hydraulic lines, etc and taking pictures to aid in re-assembly
adventure and are confident we have addressed all other potential
issues. Of course, my life has proven that such confidence is
almost always misplaced. If you have time, we would appreciate
any tips, potential problem areas or reminiscences about your
process you might want to pass on.<BR>
Thanks in advance,<BR>
Sam</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">------------------</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Okay, here is the story about my conversion
of my 240D from an automatic to a manual transmission as several
have asked. This might be a little long, so hit the delete key
if you're not interested or scroll down to find something interesting.
I'll try to include all key points in the story, but if I leave
something out, please let me know and I'll do my best to answer
your question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">My '83 240D had an automatic transmission
with almost 293K miles on it. I am the original owner of the car
and have had the transmission serviced every 30K miles as suggested
by the manual. The transmission has been relatively reliable with
a modulator problem here or there. Shifting has been reasonable,
but there have been times when there was a little hard shifting
or slight flaring. I hope that is all ancient history now with
the stick shift.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">In early July, all of a sudden the transmission
just appeared to give out. It would not shift out of first or
second gear and the engine would rev to very high rpm's as the
car slowed to a crawl with the transmission flaring very badly.
I looked for advice on this list and the wiser minds told me that
it was time to junk this transmission and get a new/rebuilt one
since all the seals were probably hard as rocks by now anyway.
Of course I still was trying to search for a $20 fix but finally
realized that it was not to be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I started looking into a rebuilt automatic
and found that the prices ranged from about $1400 to $1800 for
parts only. Installation would set me back another $600 or more.
I called Dave at Atlanta Stuttgart Auto Parts to ask if he had
any good used auto transmissions. He said they go out the door
as fast as he can get them in and that he did not have any autos
in stock. He suggested that I consider a Euro auto or maybe convert
mine to a stick shift. That peaked my curiosity and we discussed
the manual conversion. He said that it was basically just a bolt
in operation and he could sell me the parts I needed for $600.
After some input from a few other list members, I decided to go
with the conversion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I used Rick Ellinger at RC Imports in
Rockville, MD. Rick owns his own shop and is active in our local
MB Club as a technical advisor. He also owns and races a 190,
so he is quite knowledgeable about tearing down, rebuilding and
modifying MB's. He estimated that it would cost me about one day's
worth of labor to do the job, approximately $480.00 +/-.<BR>
So I had my car towed over to him on a Thursday, had Atlanta ship
the parts to arrive on Friday and expected to pick the car up
the following Tuesday. Well, it is now almost three weeks past
that Tuesday I was supposed to have had the car done and I just
got my car yesterday. Several things happened to cause the delay,
all frustrating, some of which no one anticipated, but stuff happens.
If this was my only car, I'd have been much more upset, but I
was able to get by without it for almost two months, so I lived
with it. So, my biggest recommendation to any of you who consider
this conversion is to expect a couple of weeks of not having your
car available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Rick did say that the conversion was
pretty much a bolt in operation as Dave indicated. The brake/clutch
pedal unit just bolts in place although Rick said this was the
hardest part of the job just because of the lack of work room
and all the wires that were in the way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The following are the parts I got from
Atlanta Stuttgart as much as I can remember: manual transmission,
drive shaft, speedometer cable, reverse light switch, clutch/brake
pedal assembly. The first transmission turned out to have a bad
third gear, so Dave shipped another one at no cost. The second
one was good, but then it turned out that there was a problem
with either the clutch pressure plate or the clutch release bearing.
After Rick and Dave talked, Dave shipped both parts to Rick to
make sure the problem got corrected. These were new not used parts.
All of these problems caused delays in my getting my car back
and added to my labor cost because the transmission got R&amp;R'ed
more than once. But I must say that Atlanta Stuttgart did their
very best to make sure things were fixed at their cost. I did
not have pay anything additional for parts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">In addition to the used parts Dave and
others recommended that I replace some other parts just because
new would be better than used in this situation. I bought about
$200 worth of new parts from my MB dealer and shipped them with
my car to Rick. The list included both flex disks, a new pilot
bearing, new pedal pads, new shift boot, new rear transmission
mount, and a few miscellaneous new hydraulic lines where it made
sense to replace 20 year old lines with new.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">So, my total cost was - $650 for used
parts ($50 shipping) $200 for new MB parts +/- $689 for installation
(original $480 estimate plus an extra $120 for a second R&amp;R
plus a few small parts and fluid)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Total cost -$1539 or about the same cost
as parts only for an automatic would have been.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">So far, after only one day of having
the car in my possession, my wife and I are extremely happy with
the feel of the car now. It seems like it has more power. The
feel of the manual transmission is excellent and easy to shift.
I hope that the mpg number improves and that after a couple of
months I feel the same way about it. The installation also looks
like it is came from the factory this way. One would have to be
very knowledgeable about these cars to be able to recognize this
as non-original. Maybe the only way to tell would be to look at
the VIN number. I am looking forward to smiling when all of you
talk about your automatic transmission problems and saying, &quot;I
don't have that problem anymore.&quot; :) I am also looking forward
to the easier maintenance requirements of the manual transmission.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Sorry for the long post, but I wanted
to try to answer everyone's questions.</FONT></P>

  </FONT><A NAME="anchor4073841"></A><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Air
  Conditioning Problems</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc"><BR>
by Marshall Booth</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The system is VERY complicated and not
easy or fun to diagnose. There are several possible problems that
your description bring to my attention. When the engine speed
and the compressor speed get out of a narrow acceptable range,
even for a few hundred milliseconds, the compressor IS shut down
and will not restart until the engine has been shut off and restarted.
This is the serpentine belt saving circuit and prevents the serp
belt from self destructing if the compressor locks up. ANYTHING
that causes the logic to read that the engine and compressor are
slipping compared to one another, WILL trigger this circuit. Now,
this can be due to:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. Slipping serp belt (improper tensioner
  adjustment or bad tensioner, oil on belt, worn belt, belt driven
  accessory is binding)<BR>
  2. Slipping compressor clutch (worn, oil on it, more then 0.5
  mm play, electrical failures here are not uncommon)<BR>
  3. Compressor speed signal degraded (poor contacts, defective
  sensor)<BR>
  4. Engine speed signal degraded (the connector near the inner
  rear corner of the battery of diesels MAY corrode)<BR>
  5. Compressor is binding and perhaps is about to self destruct
  (these Nippondenso compressors seem to average maybe 150 kmi
  of service though I had one go past 230kmi) and maybe a thing
  or two I HAVEN'T remembered.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">There are also sensors that measure temperature
in the cabin and at the evaporator. If proper air velocity isn't
maintained (by the little fan located under the passenger's side
air vent near the door) over the in-cabin sensor (and the sensor
MUST work correctly too) the cabin temp control will be erratic
(but if the fan speeds up - it is responding to the temp discrepancy
so the cabin sensor IS probably working correctly). The evaporator
temp sensor is defective in one direction (reading the temps as
to high), then the temperature can drop to freezing and the moisture
from the air WILL freeze blocking the evaporator (and threatening
to damage it as well $$$$) and temps WILL rise and will not return
properly until the ice melts (this has SOME of the characteristics
you describe). If the evaporator temperature sensor reports the
temperature as too low, the compressor will shut off at too high
a temperature and you will NEVER get properly cold air flow from
the vents (I don't think this is you primary problem).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Gasoline cars have at least one engine
temp sensor that diesels don't and I always forget these - if
bad the compressor is not allowed to engage until the temp signal
gets into a sufficiently low range and that can be almost never
if the sensor is bad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Then there is the possibility that there
are a couple or several different problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">These things are all pretty straight
forward to diagnose, but it's time consuming and you MUST have
the heating/AC manual, the electrical manual and the chassis manual
to be assured you have all the available information (it IS all
contained on the CD as far as I can tell). Then it's just a matter
of testing it part by part. Even for someone familiar with the
system an hours diagnostics is usually needed for common problems
(there are one or two that I can find in 5 minutes ;-) and if
it's a rare problem, much more diagnostic time (hours!) may be
required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">--<BR>
If the compressor doesn't turn by hand (you should feel a little
resistance in steps but not a lot) then the compressor is frozen
and almost sure requires replacement. You will also need to replace
the dryer, and perhaps the expansion valve (not at all fun in
a W126) and possibly even the manifold hoses if the old compressor
chewed up metal parts. It will likely require the system be flushed
as well (to clean out any metal fragments). This is NOT a minor
job!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">With a little luck, you might get by
for $500 with a very knowledgeable tech doing ONLY the absolute
minimum that was required, or it could cost well over $1000 to
do what SHOULD be done for the best chance of the fix lasting
and giving really good service.</FONT></P>

  <H2><A NAME="anchor29743567"></A><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Aux Fan
  Removal and Installation</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">On Sunday, July 6, 2003, Neil Chandler
wrote:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">A week ago I requested help on how to
remove the auxiliary fans on a W124 E420. Thanks to the this wonderful
list, and the people who are members, within hours I received
four replies. I would like to publicly thank Richard McGinnis,
Mike Yox, Kevin Kenner, and Marshalll Booth. The instructions
worked just as described, and I have replaced the faulty fan.
There are a few variations an E420, so I thought that I would
describe them.<BR>
<BR>
-Before you start, buy some new plastic rivets for the fan housing.
P/N 123-990-00-92, 70 cents each at the dealer. The fan P/N is
000-500-85-93, $138 from Caliber.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><BR>
-Remove the bumper, which is held on by 7 bolts, all visible and
easy to reach. This lets you see everything, and avoids working
below the car. You will also have to remove the license tag, and
the carrier which holds it. In my case, I found that the carrier
fits onto a metal strip, which was badly rusted, and needed replacing
anyway. Remove the clip that holds the outside temperature indicator
sensor in place, and poke it back into the bumper through the
large hole. For a big piece, the bumper is surprisingly light
and easy to handle. One person can do it easily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><BR>
-Remove the right head-lamp if you have to remove the right fan.
(No need if it is the left fan). The two 8mm bolts which hold
the outside edge of the right fan are almost impossible to start
unless you can get at them. The head-lamp cannot be removed until
you first remove the associated indicator assembly, released by
a spring clip inside the black plastic air duct on the back of
the head-lamp. The metal trim rail immediately below the lamp
is secured with an 8mm bolt at each end. If you have head-lamp
wipers, remove the arm, but leave it hanging on the water supply
tube. Remove two more 8mm bolts visible inside the indicator housing,
the upper clip (turn it 90 degrees), and the inner 8mm screw,
next to the condenser, and the head-lamp can be wiggled out. If
the wiper motor gets stuck, slide the rubber cover up the shaft,
and loosen the 17mm nut holding the motor to the bottom of the
lamp assembly. It will come out and go back in all in one piece.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-As Richard said, remove all 6 spring
clips that hold the fan shroud, radiator, and condenser in place,
and push them all back gently against the thermo-clutch. NB -
Put a piece of cardboard between the fan and the radiator.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-Remove the horns and unplug them, and
remove the reusable tie-wrap that holds the loom to the brace..<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">- Working in between the condenser and
below the upper chassis cross-brace, using an offset ring wrench,
remove the bolt which holds the top of the brace. There is not
enough room to use a ratchet. Remove the bolt on the front of
the upper chassis rail which also holds the power steering cooling
loop.Remove the bolt that secures the bottom of the cooling loop
to the body. Remove the screw holding the cooling loop to the
chassis, behind the left head-lamp. This allows the loop to move
a little more.Working from behind the bumper frame, remove the
bolt that holds the bottom of the brace, and lift out the brace.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">- Remove the air-tube to the left head-lamp
air duct, unplug the sensor, and lift out the duct. (Do not forget
to reinstall the sensor before you start the engine to test, because
if you leave it off, it will set the red engine trouble light).<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-On top of the chassis rail behind the
head-lamp, you will see a clip holding the male and female plug
for the power supply to the fans. Pull off the clip, and separate
the two halves of the plug. Remove the tie-wrap holding the end
of the fan loom. (If you did not already do so, this is the time
to function-test the fans, but use a direct line to a battery,
as the fans draw a lot of current.)<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-The fans are bolted onto the condenser,
and are covered by a plastic molding. The molding is held in place
with 6 plastic rivets. There are four across the top, easily visible
and accessible, but the lower two are only reachable from below.
The center pins may be brittle and break off in place. In this
case, just push them inward, through the rivet, and then remove
the outer part of the rivet.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">- Remove the fan molding. This takes
a lot of pulling and pushing, but the molding is flexible, and
comes out upwards.(When it is re-installed, there are three lugs
which fit into the condenser, which are only visible when the
bumper has been removed)<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-The fan power harness is actually two
separate cables inside one sheath. Each fan has a power lead coming
off it, which is held on a bracket attached to each fan. The harness
ends in two female two pin plugs, with side clips which must be
depressed to separate the plug assembly. If you want to test or
repair the harness, there are two clips securing it to the condenser,
but there is no need to remove them otherwise. It is not easy
to remove them without breaking them. Unplug the plugs, at which
point you can also test each fan one by one if you want. Be sure
to securely reseat the plugs when replacing them. It is a lot
of work to fix a loose plug!<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-The fans are held to the condenser brackets
with a total of 6 ea 8mm bolts. As Richard said, the upper right
and the lower left, on the outer edges, are bolts with a loose
nut (which is hard to find if you let it drop by mistake!). The
other four are all threaded directly into the fan outer housing
ring.. The outside 4 are all visible, but very difficult to get
at, as there is only1/2 inch of clearance. A ratcheting gear-wrench
is the ideal tool for this. The two center bolts can be reached
through one of the larger gaps in the fan blades, using a 1/4
inch ratchet. If you only want to remove one of the fans, leave
the outside bolts in place for the fan to be left in place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-Remove the fans upwards, wiggling the
loop as you do so.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-Remove the clip which holds the wiring
plug from the old fan, and re-use on the new fan.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-I found that the most difficult thing
to do was to start the 8 mm bolts on the outer edge of the fans,
simply because there is no access to get at them.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-Clean out the space between the radiator
and the condenser, and at the bottom of the front of the condenser.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-When you replace the bumper, be sure
to re-align the ventilation ducts and the upper rubber moldings,
and don't forget to run the temperature sensor back through the
hole first. Replace the right head-lamp.<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">-Test the fan functionality with a separate
power supply at the main harness plug, then reinstall the head-lamp
duct and back cover, and air tube, with the air temperature sensor
put back in place.</FONT></P>

  Cradle Inspection and Cleanup</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">by Hank van Cleef</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Subject: [MB] Battery cradle inspection
and cleanup</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Shades of the Beech Bonanza! (Which also
had its battery at the right rear of the engine compartment, just
above a bunch of stuff).<BR>
A couple of weeks ago, my weekly under hood inspection revealed
a hint of white corrosion at the outside (fender) end of the battery
cradle. I recall that a recent article in the &quot;Star&quot;
said &quot;attend to this NOW.&quot; So today, a relatively dry
nice warm Colorado day, I got a &quot;round tuit.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">For those not familiar with the drill,
here are the steps on a 126.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. Unlock the car, to disable the alarm
  system.<BR>
  2. Remove windshield washer fluid, using the &quot;not used for
  cooking&quot; turkey baster (certainly, you have one of *these*
  don't you?). The reservoir holds over a gallon (4 liters). An
  old gallon milk container came in handy here.<BR>
  3. Disconnect the two (with headlight washer) connectors (pull
  off), the washer fluid warning sensor (squeeze tabs and pull
  off) and any heater connectors (my car has none).<BR>
  4. Remove the hose tie-wrap. To free up this D-B style, rock
  the stop tab back with a small pair of pliers, and use a screwdriver
  to start unwrapping the long tab. Finish the job with fingers.<BR>
  5. Lift out the windshield washer reservoir and put it aside
  for cleanup before reinstallation.<BR>
  6. Disconnect the battery, negative terminal first. Remove the
  positive cable tie-wrap near the battery, to get more clearance.<BR>
  7. Remove the hold-down plate(s) attaching nut and plate. Set
  aside for cleanup. NOTE: My car (which originally came with a
  smaller battery), has one plate on the front, although there
  are studs for two. Do the big-battery cars have two plates here?
  What's in there now is a Very Large Interstate, which fills the
  whole cradle.<BR>
  8. Lift out the battery.<BR>
  9. Vacuum out the area. I have a large wet-or-dry shop vacuum,
  which is unbeatable for things like this.<BR>
  10. Remove the nut and washer at the right front of the tray,
  and three bolts holding the tray in place. Note the location
  of the bolt with a flange on it (fender bracket). If you've got
  rust on the nut, soak it with penetrating oil first, and work
  it loose carefully. That stud would be easy to snap, and looks
  like a terror to replace.<BR>
  11. Lift up the cradle and remove the tie-wrap at the front.
  Remove cradle from car and set aside for cleanup.<BR>
  12. Vacuum out the area under the cradle and inspect. Unfasten
  tie-wraps as needed to get a good view of things and gain access
  for a wash down.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Reassembly is the reverse of the above.
Refasten all tie wraps under the cradle and double check wiring
harness dress and windshield washer harness and hose locations
before putting the cradle back in place. Vaseline on the nut,
washer, and stud on the right front corner of the cradle is a
good idea. Also, be sure to clean the battery terminals thoroughly
before reconnecting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Wash down:<BR>
What I used under the cradle was a solution of baking soda in
warm water, which will neutralize any battery acid corrosion products.
I followed this with a good detergent solution wash, using brushes
and sponges to get everywhere. Then flush the area with water.
The wet-dry vacuum comes in handy for hastening drying. Get all
the old leaf mold, sand, and other dirt out of there. Use Naval
Jelly applied with a Q-tip on any surface corrosion, flush thoroughly,
allow to dry, and prime and paint with appropriate products (Rust-Oleum
paint is good for this). Note that the area is not normally visible,
so color mismatch on the fender inner pan is not a serious consideration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Right now, my cradle has been washed
off with a baking soda solution, and is going through the dishwasher
as I write this. I don't normally recommend putting car parts
through a dishwasher, but this is one part that will tolerate
it. Once it is dried, the cradle will get the Naval Jelly treatment,
a good rinse with a stiff bristle brush, and be repainted black.<BR>
The windshield washer reservoir can be washed down on the outside
with dishwasher detergent and a stiff brush. Rinse off an allow
to dry. Don't drown the heads of the two pump motors while rinsing---they
want to stay dry.<BR>
I'm surprised at the quantities of plumbing and wiring that runs
under this area, and there is a big torsion bar mount under there.
Tremendous opportunities for serious damage if neglected. I now
see that an annual inspection of this area is a good idea.</FONT></P>

Subject: [MB] W123 coupe rust abatement and prevention<BR>
I removed my battery tray and eliminated it's rust. Removed the
flakes of rust with a wire brush and Dremel tool. Then applied
'Rust Mort' to convert the remaining rust. Followed by primer
and 2 coats of paint. It looks great now.<BR>
While I was in there, I noticed some potential problem areas that
encourage rust. The front body drains get clogged and hold a wet
mulch in the cowl/fenders. May apply to all W123 series cars.<BR>
There are water drain holes in the cowl, just below where the
hood hinge pivots attach to the body. Mine were clogged with mud,
damp dead leaves and 'mulch'. I cleared this out and found one
5mm dia spot of rust shortly after I bought my car 20 months ago.
At that time, I did a half vast job and didn't completely clear
ALL the water drains. I finally got around to doing it right this
weekend.<BR>
When I recently had the battery tray out, I could see another
drain, just below the upper one. There is a similar drain on the
left side, in the area below the fuse block. These drains were
also clogged with dried mud, etc. I could not clear these drains
due to an unseen obstruction below.<BR>
Inside the front fenders are plastic covers with their rubber
seals. There is a part of this plastic which acts like a cup,
just below the lower drain holes. This was the obstruction to
clearing the lower water drain holes. I removed the 8mm sheet
metal screws that hold the plastic cover to the fender and removed
the plastic cover.<BR>
Now that this part was removed, I could see and clear the water
drains from below. I also gained access to the inside of the fenders.
The part of my front fenders that are just above the jacking point
were full of (fortunately bone-dry) leaves and dirt. Lots of leaves
and dirt, like 2 cups full on each side! If this stuff gets wet
and stays wet, inside the fender or front rocker panel area, it
will eventually rust the car from the inside out.<BR>
I'm glad that I took the time to clean that debris out and search
for any rust formation. It was a filthy job removing the plastic
covers, my hands were black with road grime after the task was
done. I recommend wearing gloves.<BR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Here is the process that I followed since
I could not find the instructions on the CD. Note all fastener
lengths and locations, they are all different.<BR>
1. Remove the arm cover and hex screw from the wiper arm<BR>
2. Remove the two rubber strips from each side of the lower windshield
by pulling them straight out.<BR>
3. Pull off the rubber weather-stripping that runs right across
the inner firewall area.<BR>
4. Remove the top outer left and right plastic covers. Each are
held in place in with two Philips head screws and are also joined
to the top inner two covers with white plastic clips. Pull slowly
to remove these fragile clips, ask me how I know. Remove the inner
four Philips screws holding the inner top two covers down.<BR>
5. Remove the 4 screws holding the C shaped rubber grommet which
is below the wiper arm mechanism<BR>
6. Pull off the engine side firewall weather-stripping.<BR>
7. Just below the weather-stripping there are 4 plastic fasteners
which hold the sound insulation to the firewall, the inner two
have a flower shape while the outer two are flat with two little
holes. All four need to be loosened, the outer two will come right
off.<BR>
8. After step 7 you can pull the insulation forward slightly and
find two Phillips screws which hold the center plastic housing
down. Remove these two screws.<BR>
9. Remove the upper left in right inner plastic covers.<BR>
10. The center grate cover should now come straight out.<BR>
11. The wiper assy has four 10mm nuts holding it in place, two
are on the far right, and one each under the rotating center piece.
Remove these nuts carefully and make sure you don't drop them
like I did as they can fall into the center black hole which is
not accessible. (MIA one hex screw.) I found a similar one holding
the A/C pipe on the left side of the inner firewall near the fuse
box which I used to replace the lost nut<BR>
12. Move the wiper assy to the right, It is not necessary to disconnect
the power cable.<BR>
13. Remove the outside temp sensor from the blower motor cover.<BR>
14. Pry loose with fingers the blower motor harness on the left
of the housing.<BR>
15. Unclip the 6-8 metal fasteners holding the blower motor cover
down, a couple may require a small screw driver, but be careful
again. Remove the cover.<BR>
16. Unplug the motor, and release the hold down strap using a
pointed tool.<BR>
17. Oil bearings with ATF. Check brushes.<BR>
As in Haynes (reassemble in reverse of above.)</FONT></P>

Subject: RE: [MB] DIY rebuild brake calipers 123</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Date: Sun, 4 Feb 2001 20:45:20 -0500
From: &quot;Mark Capozzoli&quot; &lt;&gt;<BR>
&gt; Has anyone ever attempted to rebuild brake calipers from
a 123? Is it possible with standard<BR>
&gt; tools? Any special tools required? I have a leaky rear caliper
on the wagon. Cost of new caliper is<BR>
&gt; around $175. Cost of a rebuilt unit is $60-$70.<BR>
&gt; Thanks, Cap</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Hi Mark, I have done the rebuild on the
brakes and maybe you can learn from my experience. The rear calipers
are smaller but similar to the front calipers. I did mine on a
116 but you should find them to be similar. The Haynes manual
for the 123 was actually pretty informative on the process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">You should do both sides at the same
time so you don,'t end up with uneven braking (so I,'m told).
It,'s also likely that the other one will start leaking soon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the wheel and undo the brake line.
The top connection will come off first by unscrewing the collar
nut. Have a pair of good vise grips to do this since it seems
to be soft metal and is round off easily. Remove the caliper bolts
on the backside of the caliper and slide off the caliper and brake
pad assembly. Remove the pins for the brake pads and the anti-rattle
springs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">For the rebuilding part, a large flat
pan is good to catch all the fluid and cleaner. Using a small
air pump (like a bicycle pump) pump air into the caliper to force
the pistons out. You can do this by attaching to the bleed fitting
and putting a finger over the brake line port. Keep your fingers
out of the way because they come out forcefully. Once one comes
out you can put it back gently and hold it against the seal to
force the other one out. The O-rings will come out if you prick
them with a needle or something. Don,'t scratch anything. Use
brake cleaner fluid for get all the sludge out. On the backside
of the piston, use a little emery paper to knock the ridge off
the backside. It,'s usually made up of corrosion. This ridge will
make the process of replacing the piston difficult and will likely
take a sizable chunk out of the new O-ring (at $35 a set), leaving
you with a leaking caliper (precisely what you are trying to fix).
Lubricate the piston bores and O-rings with new brake fluid. Put
the O-rings in. Replace the pistons by pressing them in. I usually
use the flat side of crescent wrench to press them in. A LITTLE
rocking and twisting action can help. Once you get the pistons
all the way seated, you need to fit the rubber boots and the heat
shields over the pistons. Everything needs to be clean and it
is a tedious process to get the rubber boot into place. Remember
the position of the heat shields and put the new ones on the same
way. Replace the pads and anti-rattle springs. The whole assembly
slips over the rotor and you need to bolt it back on with new
caliper bolts (locktite included).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If it leaks, remove and repeat process
with new o-rings. After doing this twice on each caliper, you
should have no leaks. Your hands will be very raw since brake
fluid and cleaner dissolves oil very well and has removed all
the oil and fat from your hands to about a quarter inch skin depth.
A couple days of coating your hands with triple antibiotic ointment
and vitamin E oil should fix the problems. Or maybe you should
wear latex gloves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">It might be worth it to purchase rebuilt
calipers since the kit is so expensive and all the chemicals are
carcinogenic.</FONT></P>

  Systems - Testing and Adjusting</FONT></H2>

Subject: [MB] Info on testing and adjusting CIS systems, save
for reference</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Listers, Lurkers, and other denizens:
Over the past couple months I've been experimenting with the CIS
system in my '87 190E-16V. It was running unevenly from time to
time, and using Techron, or several tanks of Chevron fuel (which
has Techron additive), generally resulted in improvements in drivability.
After checking other systems and sensors, I narrowed down to the
fuel system, particularly the fuel distributor and injectors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The results of my tinkering and testing
are applicable to all CIS systems (most gas cars before 1993)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Earlier last year I had kludged together
a fuel delivery test apparatus which I used to check the fuel
delivery rates and injector patterns. For those of you familiar
with the Bosch fuel delivery tester, it is an electro-hydraulic
device that measures fuel flow in cc's per minute or some similar
units. However, it is expensive and not readily available. I went
to my local MB shop and 16V racer/expert (Rick Ellinger's RC Imports)
and wheedled some leftover steel fuel lines from him (the ones
that go from the fuel distributor to the injectors). I straightened
and bent them to get a set of four that screwed onto the top of
the fuel distributor, went up about 6 inches, then hooked down,
in a line of four, so I could screw the injectors onto the ends
pointed down. I then got 4 test tubes of 15 cc capacity and drilled
4 holes in a block of wood to hold them aligned and spaced with
the fuel injectors. This way, I could collect the output of the
injectors into the test tubes and measure how much was delivered
in a period of time, or (what's really important) how much fuel
was delivered through each injector relative to the others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">To use the setup, I put a jumper into
the fuel pump relay socket to run the pump, and pressed down on
the air flow plate to replicate idle, part-throttle, and WOT fuel
flows. By swapping injectors to different fuel lines, and testing
at different flow rates, I determined there was almost 10% variation
in the fuel delivery to the cylinders. Swapping the injectors
did not make an appreciable difference in fuel flow, which is
to be expected, because the differential pressure valves should
minimize the effects of variations in injector opening pressures.
Therefore, variations in fuel flow were isolated to differences
in the 4 circuits of the fuel distributor. By testing different
air sensor openings, I determined that the differences in fuel
flow were significantly the same for both low, medium, and high
flows (idle and WOT and in between). That is to say, if one cylinder
was rich at idle, it was also rich throughout its range.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The Mercedes Manual for the 16V and the
regular 190E say that up to 10% variation in fuel delivery is
within tolerance. I have a hard time with this spec, because a
10% variation in the resulting mixture makes a significant difference
in power and emissions. For example, if the leanest cylinder is
at 15.4:1 (lambda=1.05), it may miss or have an incomplete combustion
occasionally, especially when cold. It will also make less power
than stoichiometric (14.7:1) and have higher NOX. If the richest
cylinder is at 13.9:1 (lambda = .95) then it will run smoother,
and make more power and be more fuel efficient, although it will
have higher CO and HC. This info, by the way, comes from Bosch's
own technical books and charts, in addition to other sources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I figured that less than 5% variation
was a much better figure to shoot for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">One of the other things I borrowed from
Rick was a spare fuel distributor, which was gummed up (he was
saving it as a core for a rebuild). I took it mostly apart (I
did not split the two halves, but removed everything else) and
cleaned it out well with Gumout spray and soaking, and got it
working again. I carefully measured the depth of the gland nut
around the plunger and the depths of the 4 adjusting screws (see
below) in order to put it back together with the same adjustments.
I put it on my car and drove it for a week to be sure it was working.
Then I started fiddling with it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The manual does not indicate how the
fuel distributors are adjusted, it only says to replace them if
the flow rates are out of spec, but it's actually pretty simple.
ON the bottom of the distributor are four 3mm Allen screw caps.
Under the caps are 2.5mm adjustment screws. These screws adjust
the spring pressure against the differential pressure valve diaphragms,
and thus the differential pressures, and thus the fuel flows.
I found by testing with the delivery apparatus that a 1/4 turn
in leaned the mixture on that circuit about 5%. By testing and
adjusting a half-dozen times, I got the flow rates within 5%.
I drove the car again with the adjustments, and it ran a little
better.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Having proved out the procedure with
the spare fuel distributor, I applied it to my original distributor
and tweaked it to within 5%. Car ran a little better afterwards,
specifically, smoother power on very light throttle and low speed
operation. It also passed emissions inspection for the first time!!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">This apparatus and procedure will apply
to any CIS car. Therefore, as I said in the subject line, save
this for reference, unless you have something better, in which
case share the wealth with the rest of us!</FONT></P>

  </FONT><A NAME="anchor4499610"></A><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Cooling
  System Diagnostics</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">by Hank van Cleef</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Some thoughts on diagnosing cooling system
questions:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Relying on absolute indications of electrical
temp gauges is risky. I have a nice Fisher Scientific dial thermometer
with a long probe that I use to test top tank temp in cars that
have the filler cap on the radiator (side tank jobs always have
it on the upper hose tank). Not too sure how will this would work
with the M-B reservoir filler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">You should be able to see the thermostat
opening on the temp gauge. &gt;From cold, drive the car at about
35-40 mph while keeping an eye on the temp gauge. It should come
up fairly quickly, then stop moving and hold that temp with light
throttle moderate speed running. On my car, that is about 83C
indicated. Do this with the air conditioning turned off.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Now, kick the car up to 60-70 mph and
go up a couple of hills. Some small temp rise is normal, depending
on the outside air temp. On my car, it will hold the indication
at 30C/80F outside temps. If the temp walks up, let it coast down
(downhill is best) to around 30 mph. over a half-mile or so, and
resume the light throttle running. If the temp comes back and
stops, you've probably got poor coolant flow.<BR>
After this (car is nice and warm now), slow down to 20-25 mph,
and do some city driving (30-40 second waits at stop lights every
quarter mile). If outside air temp is above 80F, A/C off, my car
will wander up into the 85C range. Resuming 30-40 MPH will lower
temp to the thermostat point. If the temp goes up (you need a
high outside temp for this), you should look for airflow problems.
These may be fan-related, but don't ignore dirt and bugs in the
radiator and A/C evaporator fins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Repeat the above tests with the A/C on
and cooling. For this you need enough outside air temp and humidity
to assure that the evaporator temp sensor is not shutting off
the compressor most of the time. This should produce a fair amount
of temp rise in the &quot;city driving&quot; test. With outside
air temp at 30C/80F and dew point above 10C/50F, my car will walk
up to about 100C, engage the fan clutch, and turn on the electric
aux fan. Operation of both is pretty obvious. The engine fan will
make a lot of noise at 1500-2000 RPM, and you can open the hood
with the temp indicating high and tweak the throttle linkage if
in doubt. The fan will speed up with the engine at moderate RPM,
blow lots of air, and roar, if working properly. You can check
aux fan operation very quickly by disconnecting the sensor connectors
and grounding each with a clip lead. On my car, the A/C sensor
makes the fan run at reduced speed, and the coolant sensor makes
it run at full speed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Keep in mind that the thermostat does
not snap open and shut at the rated temp, but has about a 10C
range where it is throttling, between fully closed and fully open.
Thus, a variation of 10C on the gauge around the point where you
can see the thermostat open during warm up is normal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">As outlined, in general, loss of cooling
control at high speed is generally related to coolant flow problems;
at low speed, airflow problems. Dirty fins will act like high-speed
troubles. If you can't see an obvious &quot;thermostat is opening&quot;
point, which is your reference point for all other tests, then
the thermostat may be failed open.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">While I've outlined a bunch of tests,
these probably can't be conducted on the same day, or on the same
stretch of road. However, since you are driving the car regularly,
you should be able to find suitable times and places for observing
behavior under various conditions.<BR>
A couple of things to remember, and use while testing:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The heater adds about 10% more cooling
when operating at full tilt. The air conditioner adds about 20%
more heating when operating at full tilt. Keep in mind that the
worst heat load condition for the air conditioner is high humidity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Proper refilling of the cooling system,
if it has been drained, can have its tricks. In particular, you
have to &quot;burp&quot; the system when refilling it by waiting
until the thermostat is open before topping it off. My car recently
had the engine out and the cooling system about as completely
empty as you can get it. I had plenty of heater gurgling and water
sipping for the first 100 miles or so after getting the car back.
Also, holding residual pressure when cold seems to be a &quot;feature&quot;
of Mercedes Benz cooling systems.</FONT></P>

  Your Cruise Control</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc"><BR>
by George Murphy</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The factory-installed cruise control
provided on Mercedes-Benz automobiles works very well for the
first 4 to 5 years of operation. It is rock steady up hill and
down and really a leg saver on long trips. But with time, the
components in the system age and begin to cause trouble. The first
indication can be intermittent loss of control or even total failure.
In this article I will cover common problems I have encountered
in the 8 years I have owned my 1978 300D and the experience of
other owners who have contacted me with cruise control (CC) problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">NOTE: The repair technique outlined below
for the printed circuit board has been successful in about 2/3
of the cases I have encountered - but it is worth a try before
replacing this outrageously expensive device.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">There are three major components in the
CC system: the control unit, the transducer, and the throttle
servo unit.<BR>
Control Unit: this device compares the actual speed of the car
and the selected speed. In the event of a deviation from the selected
speed the control unit sends pertinent control signals to the
vacuum- or electrically- actuated throttle servo unit until the
actual and selected speeds are again in agreement.<BR>
Transducer: a speed sensor mounted on the speedometer cable (early
version) or on the speedometer (later version). The transducer
sends the actual speed signal to the Control unit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Throttle servo unit: (early version)
a vacuum-actuated servo, which positions the engine throttle to
attain the selected speed. Later versions utilize an electric
servo motor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">In order to trouble-shoot the system,
you should have a digital volt-ohm meter, some test leads with
alligator clips, plus straight and Phillips-head screwdrivers,
metric wrenches, and a trouble light. But first of all, check
the obvious - is the fuse blown?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. Locate the throttle servo unit in
the engine compartment. The vacuum unit is similar to that shown
in Figure 1. Check the vacuum and vent lines - replace the small
rubber hose couplings if they are cracked. Age and heat can cause
deterioration of these rubber parts - as well as other couplings
under the hood (and throughout the car). The electric unit looks
like a small metal box with a linkage connected to the throttle.
Check that the linkage is secure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">2. (Vacuum units only) Pull the 2-pole
connector from the throttle servo unit. Connect an ohmmeter to
the servo unit pins. The resistance should be between 10 and 22
ohms; if not, replace the throttle servo unit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">3. (Vacuum units only) Follow the actuating
cable from the servo to the engine throttle linkage. Check that
the end of the actuating cable is just touching the throttle lever
with the least possible free play, but not exerting any force
on it (otherwise the engine idle could be increased). If the end
of the actuating cable is not touching the linkage, turn the adjusting
nut (Figure 2) in such a manner that the end of the actuating
cable just touches the throttle linkage. CAUTION: on diesels,
turn the idle speed adjuster knob completely to the right and
hold the emergency stop lever (on the throttle linkage) all the
way to its stop before adjusting the nut. This adjustment assures
that the vacuum-operated throttle servo unit is operating in the
middle of its range, which gives the best control and response.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">4. To check the speed transducer, remove
the left hand cover under the instrument panel. On early models
the transducer is located in line with the speedometer cable.
On later models, it is a small black box about 1&quot; square
mounted on the back of the speedometer head. (You may have to
push the instrument cluster out of the dashboard to reach the
backside of the speedometer). Unplug the 2-pole connector from
the transducer. Connect an ohmmeter to the transducer. Early models
should read 50 to 106 ohms; later versions should read 650 to
1370 ohms. If these values are not attained, replace the transducer.<BR>
If the above steps do not solve your CC problem, then the control
unit could be at fault. In order to do any repair on the control
unit, you will need a soldering iron of not more than 25 watts,
plus a small amount of fine resin core solder wire. (These can
be obtained at Radio Shack for a few dollars)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. Remove the left hand cover under the
instrument panel. The control unit is contained in an aluminum
box about 1&quot; by 4&quot; by 7&quot; and is secured by a single
bolt to the brake pedal bearing bracket. Remove the bolt, unplug
the electrical coupling from the unit, and remove the unit from
the car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">2. Carefully bend back the crimps on
the aluminum housing so the printed circuit board can be withdrawn
from the box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">3. Inspect both sides of the printed
circuit board for burned or melted components. If there are any,
the unit will have to be replaced. If the board does not show
any obvious signs of overheating, it may be repairable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">4. Look at the two sides of the printed
circuit board - mounted on the component side are various transistors,
diodes, and integrated circuits; and on the &quot;foil&quot; side
is a confusing pattern of thin copper foil &quot;wires&quot; soldered
to the wire leads of the various parts on the opposite side. The
control unit generally fails whenever one or more of the soldered
connections on the foil side become loose due to vibration or
heat. If you are very careful, it is possible to re-solder these
connections and get the unit working again. For this task, you
will need a steady hand and the 25-watt soldering iron (and possibly
a magnifying glass to inspect your work).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">5. Solidly position the printed circuit
board foil side up in a well-lighted work area. Starting at one
end of the board, carefully apply heat with the tip of the soldering
iron to each solder joint on the board. CAUTION: Apply only enough
heat to cause the solder around the connecting wire or lug to
momentarily melt, then remove the soldering iron and allow the
soldered joint to &quot;freeze&quot;. Make sure no solder flowed
to an adjacent connection or you will have a short circuit. You
may add a small amount of solder if the joint appears to be lacking
enough for a good connection. The solid-state devices cannot tolerate
excessive heat, so use care with the soldering iron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">6. After you have re-soldered each connection
on the board, closely inspect for solder &quot;bridges&quot; between
connections that can cause a short circuit. The connections may
appear slightly discolored from your re-soldering efforts, but
no harm should occur if you were careful with the heat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">7. Replace the printed circuit board
in its housing and carefully re-crimp the sides of the box. Reinstall
the unit in the car and make sure all connections are secure.
Be sure to check the fuse for the unit in the fuse enclosure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">8. IMPORTANT: If you are not sure, check
that the brake light bulb in each tail light unit of your car
is an original equipment OSRAM or BOSCH bulb. DO NOT USE U.S.
TYPE 1157 BULBS - THEY CAN DAMAGE THE CONTROL UNIT BEYOND REPAIR!
The correct bulbs are available from your M-B parts supplier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">9. Take the car out for a road test and
actuate the CC in accordance with the owners manual to make sure
it works properly.<BR>

pointed tool inserted into the hole in the clip. Lift the clip
upward (or downward for the upper ones) while applying an outward
pulling force on the assembly - I use needle nose pliers padded
with a cloth on the jaws so as not to mar the vent vanes. Don't
pry against the dash - it's soft and can be torn or dented. Just
maintain an outward pull on the assembly while you lift each spring
clip in turn - the vent assembly will ease on out. It is then
a simple matter to unplug the illumination bulb and replace it.
DO NOT USE MORE THAN 0.4 WATT BULBS - the excess heat will distort
the plastic bulb holder and make it impossible to ever get the
bulb and socket out again. The correct bulb is part no. 000 825
00 99 - a tiny push-in type bulb with gray plastic sleeve and
straight contacts. The bulb wattage is marked on the gray sleeve.<BR>
CENTER OUTLET: In this case, first release the operating lever
inside the vent using a metric Allen wrench (about 2 or 3 mm)
to unscrew the flap link from the wheel. Shine a light inside
the vent along the right side of the wheel - the Allen screw is
visible inside - unscrew (turn counter-clockwise) the screw to
release the link. On the right side, there is a Phillips-head
screw accessible when the glove box door is open. As above, look
inside for spring clips to retract that will allow the assembly
to move outward. Use same size bulb as above. When re-assembling,
after the unit is seated, re-attach the wheel link to the flap
lever by engaging the Allen screw and rotating it clockwise. Tighten
the screw only enough so that the wheel closes the vent with slight
resistance. (If you over tighten it, you get to buy a new assembly...)<BR>

  to Remove the Door Panels in W124 Models</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc"><BR>
by Unknown</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">While this subject has been covered before,
I thought I would share a couple of reminders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The door check straps were original and
creaking. I had done this same R&amp;R on my 1990 model. When
I began to remove the trim pieces on the 1992, I realized that
I couldn't remember where the clips attached etc. Hopefully, this
will save someone some fractured plastic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. The triangular shaped molded pieces
at the front of each door are tricky. There is a male plastic
piece that presses into a plastic female receptacle. This is on
the leading edge (Front of Car) towards the top. There is also
a small pin on trailing edge about 2/3rds up from bottom. Suggest
sliding a blade underneath the piece find these locations. The
molding has a hook at the bottom, so you need to pry at the top
near these two pins. I managed to break the small pin on each
side and the other pin on one side. 10-year-old plastic is brittle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">2. The two plastic molding pieces that
surround the door pull and the electric seat controls are a press
in fit. However, the piece surrounding the door pull has a hook
at the bottom. Pry from the top.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">3. Remember to remove the plastic C-clip
that surrounds the shaft for the seat control. It is not obvious,
unless you know it's there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">4. Remember to remove the door lights
at the bottom of each door panel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">5. Removal is an upward push. Re-attachment
is the reverse, but will require a few unsuccessful attempts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">6. After removal of the door panel, check
for loose nuts on the shafts attached to the wood trim strips.
All of mine were loose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The R&amp;R of the check straps is very
simple. Window up, three bolts and the door pin, goodbye creaking.<BR>
Hope it helps,<BR>

  Gauge Sender Removal &amp; Installation</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">by Dan Penoff</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">-----------------------------------------</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Replace the tank sender with a variable
resistor and varying it from max to min and the needle hangs or
doesn't hang - answers a question. When the sensor is in the full
position the resistance should be about 2 ohms. When the tank
is empty the sensor should read ~80 ohms. The kind of fluctuation
you report after the level drops to the 1/2-1/4 mark is TYPICAL
of a fatigued fuse or dirty contact in the circuit. YOU HAVE REPLACED
(not just visually inspected) THE FUSE for the instrument gauges
HAVEN'T YOU? Dan Penoff wrote a nice description of cleaning the
immersion tube transmitter assembly and I've included it below.<BR>
Marshall<BR>
------------------------------------------<BR>
Tools Needed:<BR>
1-13/16&quot; socket<BR>
8mm socket or wrench to remove seat back bolts Lots of clean shop
towels or rags.<BR>
Plenty of room around car for seat bottom and back to clear doors
while removing.<BR>
Fuel tank as low as you dare to go with it.<BR>
Procedure:<BR>
1.) Remove rear seat bottom by releasing 2 red clips on forward
bottom edge of seat frame. Pull to one side on the clips while
lifting up - you'll feel the seat frame come up as soon as they
release. Lift up on the forward part of the seat bottom and pull
towards the front of the car. Carefully remove seat bottom from
car.<BR>
2.) In the center of the seat back below the armrest is an 8mm
screw. Remove it. On either side at the lower corners of the seat
back are metal brackets with 8mm screws in them. Remove these
as well. Climb into the center of the back seat area and lift
the seat back straight up. There's a metal lip on the back of
the seat that hooks on two &quot;ridges&quot; just below the parcel
shelf. Lift the seat back off of these and carefully set it down
in the back of the car. CAUTION: Use two people for the next step!!<BR>
3.) With another person's help lift the seat back and remove it
from the car. Why two people? Because if you try to do this yourself
the seatback is too heavy. You'll end up dragging one of the corner
brackets across the top of the wheel well or somewhere else around
the door area. I have the scars to show for it. Now is a good
time to apply some Leatherique to the seat back and bottom while
you have the whole thing out.<BR>
4.) After wading through the spare change, candy, Cheetos, etc,
you'll find some black insulating/sound deadening material draped
down the back of the seating area. On the left rear (driver's
side) there will be a cut-out just below the parcel shelf. Carefully
pull this portion back. underneath is a large (3&quot;-4&quot;)
diameter plastic plug. Pry it out of the opening it seals.<BR>
5.) You are now looking at the top of the gauge sender. Carefully
remove the electrical connector and move it out of the way. Place
your socket on top of the sender and turn it counterclockwise.
Once unscrewed all the way, get ready with some shop rags/towels.<BR>
6.) Carefully and SLOWLY lift the sender assembly out of the hole.
As you lift, fuel will be draining out of the cylinder. There
are two holes in the side, one near the top, another near the
bottom, with still a third in the base. Look down into the tank
as you get close to the bottom of the sender or listen carefully
to tell when the fuel has stopped draining from the sender. Have
some towels or rags ready, as when you remove the sender from
the tank there will still be fuel dripping from it. Be patient!
Too many of us have pulled the sender out prematurely and gotten
baptized with #2 diesel. Yuck! Take the sender to a clean work
area where you can disassemble it and lay the parts out.<BR>
7.) Start by wiping the outside of the sender with a clean towel.
You'll be amazed at the nasty black stuff all over. get used to
it -you're going to see more . . . On the bottom of the cylinder
is a small round &quot;nut&quot;. Carefully unscrew this with
a pair of pliers and put it aside. Gently twist on the bottom
of the sender and it will start to come apart. Be prepared for
more fuel! Here's what you will find:<BR>
A.) Flat metal disc that covers the bottom of the plastic plate
and acts as the &quot;floor&quot; for the maze.<BR>
B.) Plastic disc that is the closure plate for the bottom. Lots
of convoluted grooves in it, like a little maze. Make sure these
are cleaned out, as they act as a damper for fuel to flow in and
out of the sender cylinder.<BR>
C.) Outer tube of the sender. Two small holes in the side, both
should be open and unclogged. These allow fuel to flow in and
out of the sender so the float will register properly. The inside
will be messy as well. Clean it. I pass paper towels (or better
yet, a non-fuzzy shop rag) through it.<BR>
D.) Sender float and guide rod/wires. Here's where the fun begins<BR>
8.) Clean all the individual pieces, saving the float/guide rod
assembly for last. You can use any number of solvents for this,
just use them in accordance with proper safety practices.<BR>
9.) Take the float/guide rod assembly and carefully clean it,
using a cotton swab or something appropriate. Handle it carefully,
as the fine copper wires on the sides are very important as you
will discover! On the bottom is a disk that lines up with two
copper &quot;arms&quot; on the float. This is your low fuel light
circuit. Make sure the contact on both the float and the disk
are clean. You can burnish them with some emery cloth if necessary,
as they will probably be pretty nasty. I like to use electrical
contact cleaner to clean the low fuel contacts as well as the
wipers and wires on the float.<BR>
10.) You may find one of the fine copper wires is broken, which
will account for no low fuel light. If this is the case you can
resolder the wire using a low wattage soldering iron and the correct
solder (60-40 electronic solder form someplace like Radio Shack.)
It has been my experience that the wires typically break at the
connection point where the original solder joint was, so no patching
is necessary.<BR>
11.) Now that you're done, carefully reassemble the pieces, paying
close attention to the placement of the plastic end cap and metal
disk. Once you have the sender reassembled don't place it in the
tank - plug it into the harness and use a jumper clip (wire with
alligator clips on both ends) to ground it. Turn on your ignition
to see if you have your low fuel level light lit.<BR>
12.) After this test, remove the connector, carefully replace
the sender in the tank, remembering to put the sealing ring on
it, and tighten with the socket. No need for brute force here,
just make sure the sealing ring is slightly compressed.<BR>
13.) Replace rear seat and related goodies<BR>
14.) Get a cold beverage of your choice and enjoy a snack from
the remnants that lie under the rear seat! Ahh! Life is good!<BR>

  </FONT><A NAME="anchor4530729"></A><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Multimeter
  101</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">by Richard Hattaway<BR>
<BR>
The following is the result of several requests to the list or
to me privately for information on how to use a multimeter or
VOM while troubleshooting a car's electrical system. It is not
meant to be all encompassing, but instead a concise summary of
how I have used a meter to my benefit..<BR>
Multimeter 101</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">There are basically four tests that can
be performed with the standard handheld Multimeter. Resistance,
continuity, voltage and amperage. I have to make some assumptions.
The tester you own has a multi-scaled analog meter, or possibly
a digital meter, and a large knob in the middle. It has two or
three places to plug in the wires, and it has red and black probes.
It may also have a knob that says &quot;zero&quot;. It may have
a switch that says AC/DC.. if it does put it in DC. The places
to plug in the red and black probes will have little symbols over
them making no sense, and are impossible to recreate in ascii..
One will be ground/negative/-/common or some such.. black wire
goes here. The second will say V/Volts/OHMS/MA or an omega sign,
and the red wire goes here. If there is a third it will say 10A
or something like that. Ignore it.. it only causes heartache..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Measuring Resistance (Ohms).. there will
be settings on the switch.. like RX1, RX10, RX1000.. and a scale
on the meter that is non-linear, starting with very low values
, but the point is that it is the ONLY scale on the meter that
is non linear. With the test leads plugged into the meter as described
above and the big switch placed in the RX1scale, you will find
that shorting the black and red test lead produces a movement
of the meter. It should be toward zero on the non linear (usually
red) scale. While the leads are shorted, you should be able to
adjust it to zero using the zero knob. If it wont go, there is
a battery inside that is weak,, probably a 1.5 volt AA or something..
the RX1 scale means you multiply the meter reading by 1. RX10
multiply by 10.. etc. but you have to zero it first. After zeroing
it, put it on the highest scale, probably RX10K, and you should
be able to measure the surface resistance of your skin. hold the
probes in each hand and watch the meter move. squeeze tight, sweat,
put them both in the same hand, etc.. it should read.. the original
lie detector, this is..<BR>
Resistance (on glow plugs).. Remove the wire from the top of the
plug.. put the black test lead on the shell of the glow plug.
Put the meter on RX1, because you are going to be reading very
low ohms, and zero the meter. Then put the red test lead on top
of the plug. You should read the 0.5 or so ohms I hear Marshall
talking about. This tests the resistance of the plug.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Measuring Continuity...Continuity is
low resistance and is measured the same way.. If the path exists
between two electrical points because there is a wire there, it
has continuity, indicated by the low resistance (~0 ohms) between
the points. Set the meter up on the RX1 scale and make your measurements.
I must be quick to point out that you NEVER measure ohms or continuity
on a circuit that has power on it. If you don,'t know, pull the
negative lead on the automobile's battery. Power will destroy
an ohmmeter in a millisecond.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Measuring Volts (Voltage).. there will
be scales on the meter that correspond to ranges on the big round
knob.. there will be ACV and DCV ranges on the big knob.. you
will use the DCV (DC volts) ranges on the car in every application
(very very rare exceptions do exist to this rule). Hopefully you
have a 15 VDC scale. This is most useful in automotive service
work, since you seldom see anything over 15 and seldom under 8.
So the readings are put in the upper half of the scale, increasing
the accuracy. On the meter you will find a linear scale that corresponds
to the knob setting. Full scale is 15, bottom is zero. With the
meter in 15 VDC range, you should be able to read the voltage
across your battery in the car. Put the red lead on the POS terminal
and the black lead on the NEG terminal. If you feel nervous about
messing around with the car battery, try a flashlight battery
out of the kitchen drawer. It should read 1.52 volts if it is
really good... 1.2 if it is discharged pretty badly.. zero if
it is like most of the ones in our drawer... If the meter goes
downscale, you have the polarity hooked up backwards. The red
lead should be on the + or POS pole of the battery, and the black
lead should be on the - or NEG pole of the battery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you want to see the charging system
work in the car, and have become comfortable with making voltage
measurements, put the meter across the battery, set it up for
15VDC scale, and have your helper start the car while you watch
the meter.. observe the steady state battery voltage before the
start.. it will be something like 12.0 volts.. as the car is cranking,
you will see the voltage drop to maybe as low as 8 volts. Make
a note of this voltage with a good battery so you will know how
low it goes.. this is an excellent full load test for a battery,
and will point out a bad cell in a heartbeat.. When you have a
bad cell, (each of which contribute about 2 volts to the system)
you have two less full load volts than you had when the battery
was good. But the voltage during startup varies from car to car..
so make a baseline note for your own use... OK, so the car starts..
now you will watch the voltage rise to somewhere around 13.70
volts. Maybe more.. sometimes less but not much less.. 13.2 volts
is about the bottom end.. This is a number that is debated about
as much as synthetic/dyno oil but you get the idea. Anything over14.5
is probably indicative of a battery with a problem or a charging
regulator gone amuck. If it reads 12.0 or slightly lower you can
bet your alternator is not charging. Stop the car, and let the
battery sit for a minute. Measure the voltage across the battery,
then turn on the lights. Watch the voltage drop slightly. Turn
off the lights, start the car, and measure the voltage at slightly
above idle rpm. Turn on the lights again, and watch the voltage
remain constant, indicating that the alternator is carrying the
load of the lights. (OK, Stu, it wont work on your &quot;rising
sun headlight system&quot; &lt;VBG&gt;) But you can watch it happen
with your very own multitester and as long as you use the same
meter, the numbers are all quasi-relative and you will become
familiar with what to expect. PLEASE do not get the leads hung
in the fan or belts while doing these experiments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Looking for that &quot;bad ground&quot;??
Well, you can disconnect the battery negative and measure resistance,
but that is not always the best solution. A voltage drop will
develop across a bad ground connection. You can measure the drop
under full load conditions (not possible with an ohmmeter, because
the power has to be off) and sometimes full load conditions change
things. Lets say the headlight is dim and you suspect a bad ground.
Turn on the headlight, put the negative lead of the multitester
on the negative battery terminal, and measure the voltage at the
ground terminal of the headlamp. It should be zero. Ground is
supposed to be ground. But if there is a &quot;bad ground&quot;
then there will be a voltage drop created across that bad spot,
and you are wasting some of your voltage there instead of delivering
it all to the headlamp. You will see this value on the meter.
Following the ground path back toward the battery will reveal
the culprit. When you get on the &quot;battery side&quot; of the
bad ground point with your read lead, the voltage drop will disappear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Measuring Current (amps or milliamps)..
If there is a third hole on the meter for a test lead, it probably
says something like 10A or 20A on it. This is for measuring high
current. It is risky, in my opinion, unless you understand well
the goings on of the meter and the circuit you are playing with.
I would leave it alone. The standard multimeter is not capable
of measuring charging current or starting current. I use the cutest
little device I got bout 20 years ago for this.. it is an ammeter
that you simply lay on the cable to the battery. The current flow
is so large that the field produced makes the needle measure the
correct (approximate) current.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">There is probably an OFF position on
the big knob. The meter does not use much power from the battery
(none, mostly) but it is a very good habit to put the meter in
off when not in use, or even between measurements.. This habit
causes you to look at what scale the meter is on and set it each
time.. this keeps you from thinking you are measuring volts when
indeed you have the meter in ohms.. result is a toasted meter,
usually popping an internal fuse that is impossible to find..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">There are many other test that can be
performed. Most require expensive meters and plug in accessories.
There has been a real good thread about Fluke meters in the past
and all the amprobes, thermocouples and such that can be plugged
into them. These are fine instruments, but beyond the scope of
most DIY's test equipment budget. I have found a simple meter
that measures Volts, Ohms, Amperage (limited as above), and DWELL
ANGLE.. (yes, dieselheads, that is something that only us old
gas car guys worry about &lt;VBG&gt;), and believe it or not,
Girot's garage has the best price I have found.. don,'t remember
what it was but it was under 50 bucks.. I recommend it. If that
is out of the budget, then I recommend a trip to Radio Shack or
your favorite building supply (Lowes has them here) and do some
shopping. Remember that the main thing you are looking for is
a 0-15 volt or 0-25 volt DC Voltage scale, and an RX1 resistance
scale (they all have that).. I bet you can find a good starter
for under 10 bucks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Also see http://www.paintscratch.com/automotive-paint-tips.htm</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The repair of a scratch and a chip are
the same. A scratch is merely a chip on uni-directional steroids.
The only problem with a scratch is that it takes more time to
be able to blend in the new paint. Items you need:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. Touchup or color matched paint<BR>
  2. Compatible primer - I like Wurth Rustop primer<BR>
  3. Organic cleaner - P21S Total Auto Wash or Wurth Citrus Degreaser<BR>
  4. Solvent - Rubbing Alcohol or Prepsol or Enamel Reducer<BR>
  5. 3M Imperial Hand Glaze<BR>
  6. Meguiar Finesse Sanding Block 2000 grit<BR>
  7. Car wash<BR>
  8. 600 grit wet/dry sandpaper<BR>
  9. Round undyed wooden toothpicks<BR>
  10. Large lightweight cardboard boxes (large shoe box or bigger)<BR>
  11. Several 100% cotton towels<BR>
  12. Magnifying glass - help for we with older eyes<BR>
  13. New Pencils with unused erasers<BR>
  14. Rubber glue<BR>
  15. Several heavy clean plastic cups<BR>
  16. Roll of quality paint masking tape</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Realize that paint chip repair is a learned
skill and should be practiced on an area of the car that is not
that visible. The hood and nose are two areas that should be tackled
last. Test all cleaners or solvents on the paint prior to usage.
I like to use the seam underneath the rocker panels. Apply a little
cleaner or solvent to a cloth and rub the seam. If you do not
get any color on the rag, then the cleaner/solvent should be safe
for the paint. If you do get color on the rag, then you may wish
to consider another solvent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">CHIP REPAIR STEPS:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">1. At least 24 hours before you want
to start, use the rubber glue to attach small 600 grit sandpaper
circles (the diameter of the eraser) onto several new pencils.
The eraser must be unused and flat on top.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">2. Step #1: Wash the car with a quality
car wash and dry thoroughly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">3. Paint chips come in two flavors. The
worst case has exposed the bare metal, while the less severe has
left the original primer intact. Clean the area thoroughly with
the P21S or Wurth Citrus degreaser. If there is rust on the exposed
metal, clean off with the pencil eraser. Use a toothpick to gently
probe the area and make sure that the edges of the chip are secure
and not waiting to fall off and destroy your work. This is an
optional step! If you do not feel comfortable with sanding or
your paint is one of the new clear coated finishes, you should
jump to step number 5. Take a new pencil/sandpaper tool, dip into
clean water and put a few drops of water on the chip area. *SLIGHTLY*
rough up the chip and a small portion of the surrounding paint.
Lightly turning the pencil will rough up an area the diameter
of the eraser and this should be more than enough. Keep the roughed
up area as small as possible, the object is to give the new paint
approximately 1 mm of old paint to &quot;grab&quot; around the
perimeter of the chip and not dig scratches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">4. Move onto the next chip and repeat
the above. Depending upon the amount of time available, you may
wish to tackle 10-20 chips at one time. Try to stay within the
area that may be covered by your box(es).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">5. When finished sanding all your chips
you are tackling at this time apply a small amount of Alcohol
or Prepsol or Enamel Reducer to a rag and wipe each chip and surrounding
area to remove any sanding dust and grease/oils. Use additional
solvent and new area of the rag for each chip. Allow to dry (these
are highly volatile and will evaporate quickly with no residue).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">6. If the original primer is intact,
and &quot;pencil sanding&quot; does not disturb the primer, then
skip the next step and go directly to painting (# 9)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">7. Make sure that the chip and surrounding
area is clean. If not, reclean with the Prepsol, Alcohol or Enamel
Reducer. Pour or spray a small amount of primer into a clean plastic
cup. Dip the point of a wooden toothpick into the primer to get
a thin coating on the first 1-2 mm of the toothpick. If there
is a blob on the end, gently scrape it back into the cup. Place
the tip of the toothpick against the center of the chip and allow
capillary action to literally flow a *THIN* coat of the primer
into the depression of the chip. Move onto the next prepared chip.
If you have finished priming all your prepared chips before two
hours are up, cover with a box, taped down with masking tape and
go have a beer. The key is to allow the first coat of primer to
dry at least two hours. Dispose of your cup and start with a fresh
cup and toothpick. Apply another thin coat of primer to each repair
that needs primer. Priming is completed when no metal is visible
and the level of the primer is *BELOW* the level of the surrounding
paint. This is important! Cover and allow to dry for two hours
or until dry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">8. Apply a small amount of Alcohol or
Prepsol or Enamel Reducer to a rag and wipe the chip and surrounding
area to remove any sanding dust and grease/oils. Allow to dry.
Repeat for all the chips that are on today's list of victims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">9. If you are using a touchup, shake
the bottle thoroughly. If you are using color matched paint, mix
thoroughly and pour a small amount into a clean plastic cup.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">10. Dip the point of a new toothpick
into the paint to get a thin coating on the first 1-2 mm of the
toothpick. If there is a blob on the end, gently scrape it back
into the bottle. Place the tip of the toothpick against the center
of the chip and allow capillary action to literally flow the paint
into the depression of the chip. Repeat for each chip. The key
is not to use too much paint. Do not redip the toothpick. Use
only the amount that will flow from one dip. Temptation to add
more paint with each application will be almost overwhelming.
Fight it!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">11. Cover with your paint box and allow
to dry 2 hours and repeat 8-12 times till the depression is filled
with paint and bulges slightly upward and covers the roughed up
area with a thin coating of paint. The first 2-3 coats may not
completely hide the primer. This is fine because you have many
more coats to go. Fight that urge!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">12. The paint application is completed
when the new paint bulges slightly upward (a fraction of a millimeter)
and had covered the roughed up area with a thin coat of new paint.
Allow the paint to dry for at least a week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">13. The touchup paint has been applied
to the surface and allowed to dry for at least 1 week, and resembles
a minute mound ( __o__ ) (this is exaggerated) on the flat plane
of the existing paint. The object is to remove the mound and make
the surface of the paint one continuous flat plane. The Finesse
Block offers the ability to gently remove only the high spot of
the repair. Unlike sandpaper or polish on a rag, the five usable
sides of the block are flat and act like a &quot;wood plane&quot;
to remove only the elevated areas of the repair. The 2000 grit
will not leave scratches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">14. Soak the Finesse Block in clean water
for 24 hours prior to use. Put a small drop of car wash on the
chip repair. This acts as a lubricant for the sanding block. Then
gently &quot;plane&quot; the high spot on the paint. I prefer
to &quot;plane&quot; in one direction (usually back to front -
drawing the block towards me). If the block dries out, re-wet
and continue use. When the new and existing paints are blended
(smoothed to the flat plane) to your satisfaction, clean the area
using a quality car wash and lots of water and then use a quality
glaze to restore the high gloss finish. I prefer 3M Imperial Hand
Glaze. Don't use a machine on your car, as it deserves to be caressed
by hand. Use a machine on your Yugo or SO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">15. When applying either a glaze or a
wax, apply to your soft cotton cloth or applicator pad (don't
squirt the stuff on the car) and work in one direction only. Don't
go around in circles like dear old dad . Circles are many times
the cause of &quot;swirl marks.&quot; A front-to-back, back-to-front
motion (the way the air flows over the car) will help minimize
swirl marks or at least make them less visible. Buff out with
a soft cotton cloth. If it looks good, wax with a quality hard
wax and you are done.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">16. Tip for applying wax. If you are
using a quality Carnauba based wax, try applying it with your
fingers instead of a pad or cloth. Hold your fingers together
and use your finger tips as an applicator pad. The tactile feedback
from your fingers will tell you when the wax has been worked into
the paint. If grit should lodge under your fingers, you will know
immediately and not grind it into the paint. A pad will not allow
this tactile feedback and these devil grits become sandpaper.
A circular motion of the pad will make a 360 degree swirl mark.
All marks on paint are most visible at a 90 degree viewing angle.
Thus the front to back marks are most visible from the sides,
whereas a circle stands out from any viewing angle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The question was also asked if clear
touchup should be used as a final coat to repair chips on a clear
coat paint. There are two view points to this question. The purist
will say yes, the paint has a clear coat and thus, the repair
should also. The process is the same as previously described,
except the clear coat is substituted for the last 2-3 coats or
paint. The practical world says no. The touchup paint is different
from the original paint and is formulated only as a touchup paint.
Once it is applied it should, according to the manufacturer, match
well enough to be all but invisible. I have found this to be the
case with the numerous repairs on the many cars/colors, I have
completed. If you are using the original paint as a touchup (I
have not done this with a clear coated car), then my understanding
is that you should use the clear as a topcoat. The color coat
of some paints will many times be relatively dull in appearance.
These paints rely on the clear coat to provide the &quot;shine.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Try one chip in an area that is not that
visible. If the process works, then continue with the rest. If
not, try the clear coat top layer.<BR>

Subject: Re: [MB] Recommended PS Fluid?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">How VERY weird Howard, my owners manuals
for ALL of my cars specify ATF and MB continued to list and recommend
ATF as approved for cars built at least 'til '88 (when cars started
coming to the US with MB fluid in them and they changed from listing
236.2/237 fluid to listing 236.3). My '87 300TD came NEW with
ATF (red stuff) in it and has never had anything else. I'm sure
the '84s and '85 190Ds did too. I don't know for sure about the
'87 W201s, but my non-turbo has ATF and the turbo has MB PS fluid.
The problem (as I understand it) is that these systems were designed
to use MB spec ATF (essentially type A ATF). My Dec '88 TDM (so
covers '89 MY cars) list 236.3 as the approve fluid, but my '85
TDM (covering '86 cars lists 236.2/237 fluid which is somewhat
&quot;thicker&quot; and refers to it also as ATF). Eric Chowanietz
covered the basics rather completely in a series posted to this
list back in 5/98:<BR>
talking with the Castrol engineer it turns out that MB's PS fluid
'Sheet no. 236.3' is actually old-style 'Type A Suffix A' ATF
but minus the red dye. However, the Castrol engineer did say that
Dexron II/III is a perfectly acceptable alternative for MB PS
applications. The key issue, it seems, is not to top-up with non-MB
fluid during the warranty period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The power steering fluid MB 236.3 is
a slightly lowered viscosity version of Type A Suffix A - ie they
start with a slightly thinner mineral oil and then friction modify
it. I would think that the low-viscosity fluid is required because
the steering system operates with a low fluid volume (0.6 litres)
and high flow rate. When the engine is at high rpm the fluid is
really moving quickly. Dexron is a fair bit thicker that the MB
236.3 fluid - in very cold conditions with a high engine speed
I imagine that there could be risk of cavitation in the pump if
Dexron were used - maybe this is why MB introduced their own fluid
in '86?<BR>
In summary, if the car is not in a cold climate I'm sure Type
A fluid would be quite satisfactory for the PS, most likely Dexron
also. In terms of 'anti-wear' properties, Dexron is likely to
be better than the MB fluid. In a cold climate I'd be certain
to use the MB stuff to avoid possible viscosity-related problems.<BR>
Stu makes it a point that ALL cars with the single belt SHOULD
use the less viscous MB fluid. The only factor I notice is that
with ATF, the steering gets pretty stiff in near zero temps. Mobil
1 ATF completely eliminates that. It MAY lubricate better then
the MB PS fluid too, but that's speculation on my part.<BR>

Subject: Re: [MB] '83 300D - hesitation on starter</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The esteemed Bob Warasila has said:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; For a couple of weeks now I've noticed a very slight hesitation
before the<BR>
&gt; starter kicks in. This morning temps were down around 20
and the starter<BR>
&gt; didn't kick-in at all. The glow plugs lit so I doubt the
battery (which as 2<BR>
&gt; year old Interstate) is the problem. In addition after 3
unsuccessful<BR>
&gt; tries, the starter kicked in and the engine started promptly.<BR>
&gt; One other clue. When I released the key the starter kicked
in momentarily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Your &quot;one other clue&quot; makes
me suspect that the ignition switch starter contacts are in trouble.
On diesels, there is a junction block under the hood that you
can jump across. If that gives reliable starter action, then I'd
suspect the switch. A voltmeter to ground from the starter terminal
at the junction block should tell you everything. If you don't
get full battery voltage when asking for a start, then your problems
are in the ignition switch, neutral switch, or wiring ahead of
that point. If you get full battery voltage, but no action, then
the trouble is at the starter end.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">&gt; When the car is warm the problem
is only present as the slightly<BR>
&gt; hesitation, so I doubt if the problem is the ignition switch.
I'm thinking<BR>
&gt; starter solenoid. Has anyone else ever experienced this symptom?<BR>
&gt; Failure of the starter solenoid to pull in reliably is often
an early warning<BR>
&gt; that the starter (not just the solenoid) is asking for attention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The solenoid has two windings: a heavy
&quot;pull-in&quot; winding, and a light &quot;hold-in&quot; winding.
Current from the ignition switch starter contacts goes through
the neutral safety switch (auto trans) to the starter solenoid
control terminal, where it connects to both the pull-in and hold-in
windings in parallel. The hold-in winding is grounded in the solenoid.
However, the pull-in winding is connected to the starter feed.
Pull-in action comes when current flows through the pull-in winding,
then through the starter brushes, armature, and field coils. When
the solenoid starter contacts close, energizing the starter from
the battery, the pull-in winding has 12 volts at both ends, so
doesn't draw current. Of course, this comes only when the solenoid
plunger is pulled in for start. If the brushes are not making
good contact, you won't get full pull-in current.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I would not pull a starter off and replace
the solenoid without taking the starter motor apart and inspecting
brushes, bushings, and connections. 99% of starter overhauls are
brushes and bushings in the motor, and maybe a file dressing of
the contacts in the solenoid, on most cars.</FONT></P>

  Chain and Checking Stretch</FONT></H2>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">by Marshall Booth<BR>
<BR>
Here is the procedure for checking the timing chain stretch submitted
by the esteemed Dr. Booth some time ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">With the valve cover off, turn the engine
clockwise (viewed from the front) using the crankshaft bolt (27
mm or 1 1/16&quot; deep socket) - don't use the cam bolt! - until
the scribed mark right behind the camshaft sprocket lines up precisely
with the molded line on the front cam tower. This alignment is
critical as an error here (say from parallax) will translate into
twice the error in reading the timing chain stretch. If you miss
- run the crank around again twice to bring the marks back into
line - don't back up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Then read off the flywheel damper the
amount of chain stretch. There is a pointer and it will be pointing
to the damper somewhere between the &quot;0T&quot; mark and the
&quot;10&quot; mark (unless your chain is REALLY in terrible shape).
A reading between 0T and 3 degrees is fine. Between 3 and 5 degrees
indicates modest wear and anything beyond about 5 degrees should
be a suggestion to change the chain. At 7 or more degrees the
chain should be changed NOW! At about 10 degrees the pistons and
the valves can begin to collide! Injection pump timing will be
off by about 1/2 the amount that cam timing is off so if the chain
is stretched 5 degrees, the pump will be off about 2 1/2 (if it
hasn't been adjusted to compensate for the chain stretch - not
usual, but some people do it). Setting the pump timing is a bit
more involved.,&Auml;&ugrave;<BR>

Time to start the write-up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Attached find pix of the bushings and
the tool I rented.<IMG SRC="MiscFiles/image004.jpg" HEIGHT="320"

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The usual disclaimer applies that working
under a car will crush you, be sure you have enough tools, experience
and sense to do this kind of work safely. This was not an easy
job, it should be left to the medium to high skill or experience
level of DIY'er.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I did come up with a great safety procedure
during this project, I have several old rims w/ mounted inflated
tires around, and after I had the car all lifted high enough to
work on and as usual, any proper point to use for the jackstand
is obstructed, I decide the mounted rims could be a last stop
lifesaver. I placed a pair of rims w/tires under the trunk floor
on the ground. At the height where I wanted to stabilize the car,
the two wheels I was using would not fit without kicking them
in tightly, but once they were in place, they were out of my way,
in a position to support the weight of the car if it tried to
fall on me, and were even spreading out the weight well so the
usual concern about whether a jackstand will damage the thing
it is going to press against was not a concern. Be assured I am
not recommending you don't use jackstands, and I never used the
wheels and trunk floor for the primary support, but if you're
working on the grass or gravel drive, jackstands aren't safe/steady
anyway, the wheel and tire support idea will work on unsteady
surfaces. This little trick will become a regular part of my under
the car safety routine. No doubt in this case it was safer than
jackstands.<BR>
<BR>
The most frequently called on tool in lots of this bushing work
has been a 12&quot; piece of 5/8&quot; all thread rod, a few nuts
and some very heavy washers, and a proper sized support tube to
pull the bushing through. I used the smallest metal tube from
the kit I rented, and the proper cap to go over it. In this case,
another perfect tube support to pull the bushing out into would
be a white PVC &quot;Coupling&quot; fitting for 1&Auml; &quot;
pipe, even better if you can use a file or grinder to remove the
center shoulder inside the PVC coupling. The shoulder may not
matter, see if the new bushings will fit into the sleeve up to
the shoulder, try it first. The threaded rod is passed through
a big washer first, then the PVC sleeve, then the trailing arm
bushing itself, and then put a nut on behind it. When a nut is
drawn tight against the washer, the bushing is pulled out by the
nut on the other end and into the PVC sleeve. You do have to cut
off the rubber shoulder of the bushing, so what is left is only
the rubber sleeve inside. That shoulder prevents the sleeve from
having footing on the trailing arm. I cut through the rubber with
a combination of small hacksaw, box cutter and big knife. Even
when it is cut through to the metal center, you will still have
to cut and tear the rubber flange off, side cutters and stout
needle nose pliers might help. When there is nothing larger than
the old bushing's sleeve part itself, it will pull through into
the PVC sleeve easily. An added benefit is that the bushing will
pull through from either direction when the shoulder is cut off.
In order to prepare to do ball joints I bought/borrowed AutoZone's
ball joint press, picture enclosed, they put $107 on my card,
when I take it back, whenever, they will give me a full credit.
Damn fine tool too, $107 would be a good price on it. Anyway,
it turns out for the trailing arm bushings the all-thread rod
and nuts and washers have done most of the work, BUT without the
selection of spacers and sleeves from the press kit, it would
not have been as easy. I would recommend renting it even if all
you wanted to use was the covers, tubes and spacers. It would
still be easier than the PVC sleeve, use that approach if the
kit isn't available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">All through this job you'll be moving
and changing the support points for the subframe and trailing
arm. Best if none of the supports is also holding the weight of
the car. The spring is still there and tightly compressed, but
the hydraulic strut is the limiting factor, with the car supported,
if you disconnect the subframe or trailing arm, the spring can't
cause the assy to sproing out of control because the strut is
in it's center and will not extend beyond it's full length. This
all assumes the strut is still firmly connected at the top.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The simplest way for me to work on the
car was drive the rear wheels up on the rhino ramps, then support
the side I was working on further with an assortment of jacks.
Leave the opposite side with the tire on and sitting on the ramp
for stability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">BIG NOTE:: You will disconnect the drive
shaft while the car is on the ramps. This is a big hazard point
if you overlook the fact that the transmission's park position
only stabilizes the car when the drive line is tight. You will
also need to rotate the rear wheels during the disassembly. That
means neither the parking brake nor the park position in the trans
will be available to you to steady the car while it is on the
ramps. YOU MUST SECURELY CHOCK THE FRONT WHEELS both fore and
aft on BOTH sides. Double check, kick the chocks in tightly, and
keep checking on them during the job. DO NOT take this lightly.<BR>
If you back the car up the ramps, then the ramp itself is in the
way of your primary rear lift and jack port. I backed up the ramps,
then used a bottle jack under the rear of the trailing arm assy,
always use wooden or plywood blocks to cushion the aluminum. Break
loose the wheel lugs first, then lift the car enough to remove
the ramp on the side you're working. Remove the wheel. I used
a 4&quot; thick block of wood about 1 foot long so the factory
screw jack could sit on the outer end of the wooden pad, and a
small bottle jack can sit under the front corner of the trailing
arm and the subframe on the other end of the same block.<BR>
Each trailing arm bushing has a thick pivot pin bolt to remove.
Both are obstructed, The subframe must be lowered to get to them.
With the small bottle jack and wooden pad support the subframe
and remove the subframe bushing cover and bolt. That is the big
as a saucer bushing at the front corner of the rear subframe.
Lower the subframe, I used a second bottle jack with pad and thick
base block to provide some support at the wheel, but it really
wasn't stressed, just in place in case. When the subframe comes
down you should be able to get to the bolt and nut, the metric
size is bigger than any I have, 21 mm maybe, but 15/16&quot; fit
great w/o any looseness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">You will have to remove both trailing
arm pivot bolts to get the trailing arm to move one end or the
other clear of it's subframe brackets far enough to pull out the
bushing. Disconnecting the drive shaft and flex disk appears to
be necessary in order to push out the trailing arm pivot bolt
on the inner bushing on the right side. The head of the bolt hits
the flex disk before it can be pulled out enough to clear the
bushing or bracket, so you're stuck. The flex disk has three bolts
through from each side, rear end flange and drive shaft flange.
Remove the three bolts that connect the rear end flange, leave
the shaft connections tight. Mark the flange and the disk in some
way so the flange gets reassembled in the same position. There
is an alignment pin sticking out of the rear end flange, into
a sleeve in the flex disk, the manual says &quot;force the shaft
off the pin.&quot; Since up, down, right left and back were all
out of the question, I pried the shaft toward the front a good
bit, must be the front flex disk giving up the slack, but by prying
the shaft forward about an inch!!, the shiny pin can be cleared
and the shaft walked and wobbled off to the side. The alignment
pin will continue to fight you, and it seems to be abusing the
flex disk, but it seems ok, that rubber is TOUGH!! Anyway once
the pin is clear of it's race or sleeve, the shaft can be swiveled
around enough to clear the bushing pivot bolt without moving the
shaft or flex disk assy very far, just an inch or two off center,
you may have to raise or lower the subframe or rear of the trailing
to get the right clearance. This is a much bigger deal on the
right side of the car, the left side is not nearly as close.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">When bolts are out and the bushings are
free, you can pry them clear of the subframe mount, or try lifting
or lowering the bottle jack supporting the trailing arm. All these
parts are under some tension, but can be pushed and pulled and
pried apart some. You'll need clearance to use the 5/8 all thread
rod. A long thin wooden rod or board, a broom handle or such,
will be handy separating the units for clearance to work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Note both bushings pull in from the outside
of the Y shape of the trailing arms, the bolts also go in from
the outside. The manual refers to &quot;slide lube&quot; I used
bar soap goo. When using the threaded rod to pull the new bushing
in, you should try to accommodate the shape of the bushing where
you are pushing on it. A flat washer would not be the best tool
to back up the bushing with, unless you can find another thin
one with a larger center hole, that will support the second metal
support on the bushing end. Observe the rubber shoulder view of
the bushing pix. The raised ring that surrounds the sleeve through
the center of the bushing is really a solid metal tube, and there
is really a bushing within a bushing. You would ideally like to
push on both the center sleeve and also on the raised ring outside
it evenly. To push very hard on either point alone looks like
it would be stressing the new bushing badly. Use the sleeve again,
rather than a big washer alone so the small amount of the bushing
that pulls all the way through won't bottom out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">When trying to get the holes lined back
up to push the bolts through, a tapered punch or small screwdriver
is handy to stick into the hole and persuade everything to line
up.</FONT></P>

more clear or complete will be welcomed. Nathan<BR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">On diesels, if the line from the vacuum
pump to the air cleaner is fouled with engine oil, the vacuum
pump diaphragm may be leaking. If so, engine oil will eventually
migrate throughout the vacuum systems in the car, causing the
rubber parts to rapidly deteriorate. If you see oil dripping from
the &quot;ignition&quot; steering lock switch on your diesel,
the vacuum pump diaphragm may be leaking or the engine shut-off
actuator on the injection pump may be leaking (and the engine
may not shut off). The lubricating oil in a diesel can eat away
the rubber parts in the brake booster, door lock actuators, vacuum
cruise control actuator, and climate control flap actuators. So
it is a good practice to check the system from time to time.</FONT></P>

in Figure 2) and insert the filter. The filter paper in the strainer
should be away from the vacuum pump. See The STAR, January/February
1992 for more on this handy device. (Gasoline engines do not need
this filter)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Now, if the diaphragm in the vacuum pump
should begin leaking, oil will be clearly visible in the filter,
alerting you to the problem and preventing oil from entering the
vacuum systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Diagnosis and repair of vacuum leaks
in 240D door and trunk locks. Written by Nathan Carter, summer
1999. <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="026c616370766770427163766b672c637076712c7771642c676677">[email&#160;protected]</a> &lt;or&gt; <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2449414345644552455045560a5345485651570a474b49">[email&#160;protected]</a></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">&lt;disclaimers: I'm not a certified
mechanic; however, I have owned two 240D's, which have been my
primary cars for the past eight years. All the following information
is more or less accurate for my 240D and may or may not be the
same for other models. Also, I'm writing this from my desk and
not from inside the car; it's as accurate as I can remember without
looking at the car.&gt;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I know this is long, but if you've got
the door lock problem you'll want to read the whole thing, even
print it out and stick it with your service manuals. The most
valuable information is near the end, but go ahead and read the
whole thing</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Everything in the car is controlled by
the vacuum system - brakes, engine shut-off, air vents, door/trunk
locks, etc. There's a vacuum pump in the engine, vacuum reservoir
in the trunk, and about four thousand feet of vacuum lines running
all over the car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Also, for some unknown reason, most of
the vacuum lines throughout the car are made out of a semi-hard
yellow plastic. After a number of years, the plastic becomes brittle
and cracks or outright breaks, especially in the corners where
the lines feed into the doors (and therefore have to flex every
time the door opens or closes).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The mechanisms in the doors that cause
the doors to lock and unlock are prone to failing. They each have
two (or four?) little rubber diaphragms that will eventually rot
and split, causing loss of vacuum. I've found that these seem
to fail all at once, or thereabouts. I've replaced three of the
four of mine over the past three years, and have a spare ready
for when the fourth fails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If the lock in your doors only work intermittently,
or only work while the car is running, or will only work once,
immediately after you shut the car off and get out, then you've
got a vacuum leak. Generally, it's one of the following: a leak
in one of the vacuum lines (semi-likely), a leak in one of the
vacuum-powered door lock mechanisms (very likely), a leak in the
reservoir itself (very Unlikely), a failing vacuum pump (very
Unlikely, and knock on wood that this isn't it).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">While the car's running, you probably
won't have any vacuum problems. The vacuum pump is powerful enough
to generate enough vacuum to overcome small leaks in the system;
when the pump is not running, the vacuum pressure will (relatively)
quickly dissipate because of the leak, and you'll have problems
such as doors not locking.<BR>
If you're the type to want to fix this yourself, you'd be well-advised
to invest in a few tools to aid your battle against the vacuum
system: - A small air vacuum/pressure meter - a hand-held vacuum
pump - some rubber tubing of the appropriate size (Note: a kit
containing all of the above can be had from IMPCO for $60) - some
wooden golf tees. The golf tees are for sticking into the end
of a piece of rubber tubing to seal off that section of the vacuum
line from the rest of the system. It works!<BR>
<BR>
The first thing to check, and generally the most likely cause
of the problem, are the vacuum-powered door lock or trunk lock
mechanisms. Here are some diagnosis steps (do all three):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">A. Sit in the car with the doors unlocked
and the car running. Do the doors lock and unlock properly? Does
the trunk lock and unlock properly? If there is one door (or trunk,
or fuel-fill cover lock) that does not work at all, even with
the car running, then you've got a huge leak in that area and
should be able to find it relatively easily. If it's a big enough
leak, you may even be able to hear it leaking. If this is the
case, then you should do a little happy-dance because it's rare
that finding a vacuum leak is that easy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">B. Sit in the car with the doors unlocked
and the car running. Shut off the car and wait for a minute or
two, then lock the driver's door. Do the rest of the doors/trunk
lock? If the other doors don't lock, then the leak MAY be in one
of your many unlock lines, or in the unlock side of one of the
locking mechanisms. This test alone doesn't tell you much.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">C. Sit in the car with the doors locked
and the car running. Shut off the car and wait for a minute or
two, then Unlock the driver's door. Do the rest of the doors/trunk
unlock? If the other doors don't lock, then the leak MAY be in
one of your many lock lines, or in the lock side of one of the
locking mechanisms. Again, this test alone doesn't tell you much.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Now, with the data you got from tests
B and C, you should be able to figure out roughly where your leak
is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Case 1: If both tests B and C failed
(i.e. no locking OR unlocking after a few minutes of the car being
off) then it's most likely that the vacuum leak is somewhere else
in the system besides the door locks. There are other systems
in the car that are also controlled by the vacuum. Engine shut-off,
brakes, climate control ductwork, probably more. I've never had
a problem with these systems, though, so can't really be of any
help here. (okay, well, I DID have a problem once where, while
doing an oil change, I accidentally clamped some vacuum lines
under the cover for the oil filter canister, but that's an unrelated
story)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Case 2: Test B fails, but Test C succeeds.
After shutting off the engine and waiting for a few minutes (doors
locked), you're able to unlock the doors, but then can't lock
them again; after shutting off the engine and waiting for a few
minutes (doors unlocked) you're not able to lock the doors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">While sitting there waiting with the
doors unlocked, there is constant vacuum to the Unlock lines (and
the Unlock side of the locking mechanisms); your vacuum reservoir
quickly empties due to a leak in one of the unlock lines and you're
unable to lock the doors because you've got no vacuum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">While sitting there waiting with the
doors locked, there's constant vacuum to the lock lines; since
there is no leak, your vacuum is reserved. When you unlock the
doors, as soon as there is vacuum to the unlock lines it is expended
by unlocking the doors and leaking out the leak. You can't lock
the doors again because there is no vacuum in your reservoir.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Case 3: The exact opposite of Case 2.
Doors stay locked; you can't unlock them because there is a leak
in the lock lines and no vacuum pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Now, for actually finding the leak! I realize this is a long,
long process, but the vacuum lines are really obnoxious to work
on. I'm going to assume that you did all the tests and came up
with Case 2 as your problem. You need to find and fix a leak in
the unlock lines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If there is one door (or the trunk) that
seems to unlock more slowly than the rest, start checking there
first. You should find two vacuum lines running to each locking
mechanism, one for vacuum-lock and one for vacuum-unlock. In my
car they are yellow with red stripe and yellow with green stripe,
but I can't remember which is which, sorry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">***Method to narrow down your search:
This is correct for my 240D, but may be different for other models.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">You can find the vacuum lines for various
parts of the car running underneath four floor mats. Pull out
the floor mats, then the sub-mats, and you'll be staring at the
metal bottom of the car. There are plastic covers that protect
the vacuum lines (and some electrical lines? can't remember).
These can be pulled aside pretty easily and you'll find the yellow
vacuum lines. Search around until you find a rubber connector
in the vacuum line; there are probably several Y-shaped splitters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Disconnect these (**REMEMBER where they
all go!) and seal them off With your rubber tubing and golf tees.
Now go repeat tests A, B, and C (as described above) and see if
you've made any difference. If some of the locks work properly
and your vacuum is reserved, then the problem is in a section
of the line that you've disconnected from the rest of the system.
You've just narrowed down your search significantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Repeat as desired until you don't have
any more places to disconnect and seal off, or until you've narrowed
your search enough to start checking out one of the doors or the
trunk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">***Examining the vacuum-powered lock
mechanism. These WILL fail sooner or later, so go ahead and check
them out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">For the trunk, it's essentially the same
steps as for the door, but the mechanism may be locked in a slightly
different place, and you have to know how to take the rear wall
of your trunk apart.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">For the door: Take off the door panel
and disconnect all electrical lines (power windows, speakers,
etc. You should have a thin sheet of plastic covering the metal
door frame; GENTLY pull it aside (you'll need to reattach it later
with some spray adhesive). Inside the frame will be the window
hardware and (voila) near the bottom, the vacuum door lock mechanism.
It looks like this (side view):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">thin metal rod to door lock knob<BR>
<BR>
two _ | _ vacuum | -+- | lines -&gt; =====|_____|</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">It'll probably be black or blue plastic
with a lot of rubber parts on it, and will be bolted or screwed
into the metal door frame. It's easier to work with if you take
it out, but getting it back in is sometimes a pain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Disconnect both vacuum lines but **REMEMBER
which is which!!** Mark with masking tape if you have a bad short-term
memory. Use your rubber tubing and golf tees to plug the end of
these lines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Two routes of diagnosis, both useful
and easy: Method #1: easier but less information. With those two
vacuum lines sealed off, go crank up the car again, give It a
few minutes to depressurize (vacuum-ize?) the vacuum reservoir,
then shut it off again. Try locking and unlocking the doors. If
they work properly, then you've found the problem to be that locking
mechanism. Call your dealer or IMPCO and get a replacement. (I
managed to find TWO Working replacements in a junkyard! yahoo!)<BR>
Method #2: More work but more information. Connect your vacuum
hand pump to one of the vacuum inputs for the lock mechanism.
Pump it and see what happens. Now plug it into the other one;
pump it and see what happens. Make a thorough visual inspection
of the two rubber diaphragms on the top of the mechanism; if these
are cracked, rotten, or split, then that's probably your problem;
the vacuum will leak out from the broken part of the diaphragm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If the locking mechanism seems to lock
and unlock properly (alternating the hand pump between the two
lines going in), and the rest of the car shows no improvement
with these lines disconnected and sealed off, then.. well, you
didn't find the problem yet. Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Now to check the yellow plastic vacuum lines:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you had sealed this part of the vacuum
line off from the rest of the system, then it's entirely possible
that the yellow plastic vacuum line is cracked or broken.<BR>
If you've got the hand pump and the vacuum gauge (or if you have
a hand pump with a gauge built in), then examining the individual
lines is pretty easy. If you don't have both of these tools, then
it's next to impossible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Connect the gauge to one end of the line
(probably the end that's in the door, the end that you disconnected
from the locking mechanism). Now go scrounge around in the floorboard
and find the other end of the same line; it's one of the ones
that you sealed off from the rest of the system. Connect your
hand pump to this end of the line.<BR>
Pump it up enough to achieve a good vacuum, then see if the vacuum
leaks out. If you can't get any vacuum at all, then the line is
either completely broken or you put your gauge and pump on different
lines (oops). If you get a good vacuum and it stays, then the
line is good. If you get a good vacuum but then it leaks out slowly,
then you've found the leaking line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you find a line that's leaking, you've
got two options: replace or repair. Replacing the line will be
more expensive and more work; repairing it is probably just as
good (explain in a minute) but cheaper and possibly less work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you want to replace the line, you
have to first go get a new piece of vacuum line (make sure you
get the right color), then pull out the old line and pull the
new line through to the right place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you want to repair the line, first
find the section that's leaking (listen for a hiss? visually inspect?),
cut it completely in half, and slip a piece of rubber tubing around
it. Now, this may be more reliable, especially in a place like
the door jamb, where the line has to continually flex back and
forth anyway. The rubber will flex more easily than the plastic
tubing.<BR>
<BR>
======== OR! the REALLY easy way ==========<BR>
If you don't want to deal with all this, just drive your car to
the dealer and say &quot;I've got a vacuum problem, please fix
it.&quot; They'll either repair it for you (for a modest fee,
plus your first-born child) or they'll happily escort you off
the lot, because they don't want to go through all this trouble
either.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">My 1976 W114 280CE has just returned
from the garage where the central locking was being fixed. The
service manager, who I trust, said that the c/l was working 5
times without exhausting the vacuum tank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I got in tonight and c/l worked unlocking
the car, drove off and there was a high pitched whistle from behind
the dash on the right of the steering wheel (RHD). I depressed
the drivers lock and the c/l worked and the whistle went away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">However when I got out of the car the

I now wish I hadn't depressed the lock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Does anyone have any suggestions? Can
I reset the c/l somehow, it appears that when I pressed the drivers

of c/l, without tearing panels / manually priming system. I'll
probably get there but this is really starting to piss me off.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Thanks in advance, Ronnie</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">What is wrong with my 123/126 central
locking system?<BR>
123/126 Chassis Central Locking Troubleshooting (applies roughy
to other models):<BR>
1.) Get a MityVac or other similar hand vacuum pump.<BR>
2.) Remove carpet from forward passenger footwell<BR>
3.) Carefully pry up cover from wire gutter on floorboard.<BR>
4.) You will find 2 sets of vacuum lines connected with a 4-way
vacuum tee:<BR>
Yellow/Red stripe - locking<BR>
Yellow/Green stripe - unlock<BR>
Yellow/Gray strip - vacuum pump &amp; reservoir<BR>
5.) Remove each line one at a time and apply vacuum. Every one
should hold vacuum. You'll see a corresponding action from the
related door/trunk/fuel door actuator.<BR>
6.) If you don't, or if a particular line will not hold vacuum,
trace it down. It's pretty obvious where they go.<BR>
7.) The one thing that might make this a little tougher is the
trunk and fuel door actuators, as they share the same circuit
in the 126. If this line does not hold vacuum you'll need to pop
the inspection cover off the trunk lock and remove the liner on
the passenger side of the trunk to get at the respective actuators.
Once exposed, remove the flexible lines from each actuator and
test both ports. They should hold vacuum in both directions.<BR>
8.) If you trace the leak to a door you will have to remove the
door panel to access the actuator. As in # 7, test both sides
of the actuator. If it holds vacuum, plug the end of the line
in the passenger foot well and attach your vacuum pump to the
end in the door. If it won't hold vacuum you have a leak in the
line, most likely inside the rubber bellows that protects the
wires and lines at the door hinge. You can do a quick fix by removing
the line part way and using a piece of flexible (rubber) line
to &quot;patch&quot; the leaking area. Hard plastic vacuum line
(clear, not yellow) is available as a stock item from most MB
suppliers.<BR>
9.) Occasionally the rubber bushing that seals the line to the
vacuum reservoir can dry out and crack. This will allow locking
while the engine is running (on a 123) but no operation once it
is shut off. Check the reservoir by applying vacuum from your
hand pump to the yellow line in the engine compartment that has
the gray stripe. It will take a fair amount of pumping to build
up vacuum, as you're trying to evacuate a large reservoir with
a little hand pump, so be patient. If after 30-60 seconds of vigorous
pumping it still does not hold vacuum you can assume there is
a leak in the line or the reservoir is leaking. Plug the line
on one end and apply vacuum from the other. If it holds vacuum
the reservoir or seal is leaking.<BR>
10.) On a 126 the vacuum is provided by a reversible pump that
has a pressure operated snap switch to reverse operation when
it reaches full vacuum/pressure. With the car turned off lock
the doors from the inside or with the key. You should hear a quiet
whirring noise coming from the trunk. If not, the pump may not
be working. Life the spare tire cover and remove the spare. In
the 4 o'clock position of the spare tire well is a metal cover.
Remove the screw on the end of the cover and lift it off. Underneath
is a large black foam &quot;football&quot; that contains the pump.Remove
the pump and unplug it from the wiring harness. Plug it back in.
If it runs and shuts off after 20-30 seconds it's timing out due
to the inability to develop maximum pressure/vacuum in the system.
(You have a leak!) Unplug and plug it back in again. If it runs
and shuts off after the delay the pump is probably good. Unplug
the vacuum line from the pump and plug the port coming out of
the pump. Plug the pump in again. If it runs and shuts off after
a few seconds each time you unplug and plug it back in it's good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Keep in mind that an actuator may hold
vacuum in one direction and not the other, so you MUST check both
sides of the system to be sure to isolate the problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Piece of cake.<BR>

Subject: RE: [MB] W 124 water pump</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Hi Bernhard<BR>
&gt; Can't be all that difficult to change the water pump. AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>
Estimated parts required - Water Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I've recently taken on the task of replacing
the water pump on my W124 1991, 200E 2.0 Litre Petrol, Automatic,
4cyl etc. I've run into trouble along the way as you may have
seen from my postings to the list but it's almost sorted now (I've
been waiting 3 weeks for a bolt that I broke while doing the job)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Here are the steps that I followed from
my Haynes manual.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Drain the cooling system - there,&Auml;&ocirc;s
a drain plug at the bottom left of the radiator looking at it
from the front If the coolant is good you could try to save it,
mine wasn't.<BR>
Remove the &quot;springy&quot; bit from the air intake duct -
it will give you a bit of room to work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the fan shroud by releasing the
clips (4) and rest over the fan blades (Mine was a one piece,
I think the split shroud can be removed from the engine bay at
this point)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the rubber hoses to the radiator
and also, if automatic transmission, remove the transmission fluid
pipes from the radiator. The manual says to clamp these hoses
before removing. I couldn't get at them to clamp on so i prepared
a &quot;plug&quot; with a pencil and some PTFE tape. If you remove
the top one first it isn't that messy i.e. no fluid escapes and
you will see the size of plig that you will need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Next remove the plastic screws from the
panels at the sides of the radiator</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the 2 large clips that secure
the top of the radiator and remove the radiator</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the fan shroud from the engine
bay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Next, remove the fan - this is where
the fun started.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I tried all sorts of things to try and
stop the engine rotating while trying to loosen the fan bolt but
to no avail</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Eventually, I fixed a vice-grips firmly
in place on the bolt and gave it a sharp blow in the opening direction
with a hammer, while placing as much pressure in the water pump
as possible with my hand (to stop it from rotating) and the bolt
loosened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">This method I reckon, could well be replaced
with the use of an impact driver. !!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Also, when the bolt loosened, the vice-grips
took flght at Mach II and proceeded to bury itself in the windshield
washer reservoir tank. This should also be avoided unless being
videotaped for one of those home-video shows ...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Estimated parts now required - Water
Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze AND new windshield washer reservoir
tank</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Now would be a good time to loosen/remove
the auxiliary drivebelt. The tensioning device is located at the
bottom right-hand side of the engine. There,&Auml;&ocirc;s a nut
located at the center of the of the tensioning device which should
be loosened 1/4 to 1/2 a turn Loosen the &quot;tensioning bolt&quot;
which is located to the rear of the thermostat housing until the
belt can be slipped off the pulleys. Remove the drivebelt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Gee, that drivebelt looks a bit worn
and shiny on the outside Estimated parts now required - Water
Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze AND new windshield washer reservoir
tank AND new auxiliary drivebelt</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Next there are four screws/bolts (Torx
heads i think they are called I think) retaining the water pump
pulley. After trying the &quot;nice&quot; way with &quot;Torx&quot;
tip - no move After further treatment with bolt loosening sprays,
tapping with hammer, heating with blow torch and much praying
I eventually reverted to method described above with vice-grips.
I think an impact driver would have helped here also.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">No need to break the windshield washer
reservoir at this point as it,&Auml;&ocirc;s already broken.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Estimated parts now required - Water
Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze AND new windshield washer reservoir
tank AND new auxiliary drivebelt AND 4 new &quot;torx&quot; bolts
for water pump pulley</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Next remove the thermostat housing along
with the hose to the water pump. It must be really difficult to
break anything here as I managed this procedure without doing
any damage However, one will probably require a new thermostat
to engine gasket when replacing the housing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Estimated parts now required - Water
Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze AND new windshield washer reservoir
tank AND new auxiliary drivebelt AND 4 new &quot;torx&quot; bolts
for water pump pulley AND new Thermostat housing gasket.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the electromagnetic fan coupling
thingy by undoing the three small nuts at the rear of the unit
and disconnect the wiring. No problems here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Remove the remaining hoses from the water
pump, Remove the alternator from the mounting bracket, top bolt
and second from bottom I think. The top bolt just screws out,
the bottom one has a nut at the rear, which has to be undone.
It's probably better to remove the bottom bolt first as it's easier
to support/hold the alternator while undoing the top one. I left
the wiring on the alternator and rested it on the bottom of the
engine compartment. Again, no problems here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">You should now have access to all the
bolts retaining the water pump, which in my case all came out
easily enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Now wait a week for the &quot;Special
order&quot; water pump</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Refitting is a reversal of removal as
they say. Make sure to clean the mating surfaces on the water
pump and thermostat housing and remove any &quot;gunk&quot; from
the threads of the bolts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Torque the water pump bolts to 8 ft/lbs
(more on that later)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Refit the alternator, EM fan coupling,
water pump pulley and auxiliary drivebelt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Tension the belt by tightening the &quot;tensioning
bolt&quot; (located to the rear of the thermostat housing) I'm
a bit hazy on how to do this properly, some have said that you
should not follow the guidance in the haynes manual. I did, and
broke a part of the tensioning device, so I'll be judging by feel
after installing the replacement part. Once the belt is tight
enough, tighten the center bolt on the device. I forget the torque
setting for that one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Estimated parts now required - Water
Pump and Gasket, Anti-freeze AND new windshield washer reservoir
tank AND new auxiliary drivebelt AND 4 new &quot;torx&quot; bolts
for water pump pulley AND new Thermostat housing gasket AND new
part for the tensioning device.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">By the way, I mentioned torquing the
water bolts to 8ft/lbs. After I broke the tensioning device I
decided to give a final check to the water pump bolts and managed
to shear one of them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">So, off with the auxiliary drivebelt,
thermostat housing, water pump pulley, em fan coupling, alternator
and water pump again ( much more speedily, I might add).<BR>
Luckily, the sheared bolt was protruding from the engine so it
was easy enough to remove.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Hold on a minute, the rest of those bolts
don't look too healthy!!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Re-fit the fan, insert the shroud, re-fit
the radiator, attach the shroud to the radiator, attach all hoses

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">It's been 4 weeks now since I started
the job. I had to wait 3 weeks for the new bolts from my Mercedes
dealer, the rest of the stuff seemed to be hassle for them to
get as well - I've got a Temperature sender/EM switch on order
from them for 4 weeks also and they as of yet haven't got it in.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I got my pump bolts on Saturday but haven,'t
had a chance to put the whole lot back together yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Good Luck</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">I hope the above doesn't put you off.
If it's of any help, things usually go wrong for me even if it's
just changing a wheel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The help and advice I got from this list
was great, I would really have given up somewhere along the line
without it.</FONT></P>

of mine was able to lend me a vehicle for the last couple of weeks.

Subject: Bad wheel bearing??</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">&gt; I haven't posted in a while, as
the Benz has been<BR>
&gt; running fine. That is until my commute home from work<BR>
&gt; tonight. While on the highway, i suddenly hear a<BR>
&gt; scraping sound, like something was dragging. I pulled<BR>
&gt; to the shoulder and had a look-see, but found nothing<BR>
&gt; out of place. I drive it slowly (40mph) the 15 more<BR>
&gt; miles to home. The scraping noise quickly gave way to<BR>
&gt; a dull growling noise. I suspected a bearing. I jack<BR>
&gt; up the right front and grab the top and bottom of the<BR>
&gt; tire, and discovered quite a bit of play. I have the<BR>
&gt; service CD, and it appears a relatively simple task to<BR>
&gt; replace the inner and outer bearings. Any words of<BR>
&gt; wisdom from anyone who has done this, before I dig in?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Richard Easley has LOTS of experience
with front wheel bearings . . .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">WHEEL BEARING REPLACEMENT TIPS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Here's a few things to consider:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">First, get the MB Chassis manual for
your car so you can do the job right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">In my experience, the grease should be
changed at the 90,000-mile service - I found my OEM grease was
getting a little stiff by this mileage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Use MB wheel bearing grease part no 001
989 23 51 10 or a good grade of lithium high temperature bearing
grease - Kendall Blue comes to mind. Of course, buy new inner
hub seals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Pull a bearing cap and look at the grease
- if it is stiff and wax-like, it is long past time for bearing
re-pack. Anyway, I do bearing grease at 90,000 miles interval
(third 30,000 mile service) since MB now uses that new green high
temp grease in all cars since 1986.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If your bearings are OK, but if the hubs
are coming off anyway for rotor change, change bearing grease
and install new seals. Thoroughly clean the hub and bearings of
ALL old grease. DO NOT SPIN BEARINGS at high speed with air gun
to dry them - be gentle with the air. Some mechanics like to have
fun by making that high-pitched whine,&Auml;&para;. using compressed
air to spin and dry out cleaned bearings - it is really hard on
the bearings to do that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Next, pack bearings by hand with MB grease
- save all excess - weigh out correct # of grams and pack it into
hub IAW the MB chassis manual. There's a reason for the specified
grams of grease for the bearings and inside the hub. Too much
leads to overheating and too little starves the bearings of grease.
The grams specified for inside the hub and the bearings just fills
the hub cavity such that centrifugal force during rotation forces
the grease outward in both directions to continually pressurize
the bearings and keep them lubricated. It has been shown that
the grease actually &quot;circulates&quot; inside the hub and
through the bearings to keep them lubricated - that's why properly
lubricated MB front wheel bearings can last so long, and that
is the reason for that 45 grams of grease.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Use the rest of the grease to fill the
hubcap. In this manner the inside seal stops the grease from leaving
the bearing due to centrifugal force, and the cap, being full
of grease, keeps the grease inside the hub/bearing area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">The 150 gram tube of MB grease will do
both front wheels - about 60 grams per hub plus 30 grams for bearings
- simply follow the MB factory chassis manual procedure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Here's data from Tech Data Manual:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">For a 150 gram tube of MB wheel bearing
grease, here's how it breaks down: (From TDM Section 33) (All
weights are approximate)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">107, 124, 201.03 models: total 65 to
70 grams - 50 in the hub with bearing; 15 to 20 in the hub cap</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">116, 123, 126: total 60 grams - 45 grams
in the hub; 15 grams in the hub cap</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">201.02/1: total 50 grams- 35 grams in
hub; 15 grams in the hub cap</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Be sure to maintain the specified charge.
Suitably weigh entire charge prior to starting assembly of front
wheel hub. Weigh quantity filled into hub. Fill roller cage of
tapered roller bearing well with grease. Also provide roller faces
with grease. Fill hub cap approx to beaded rim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Starting 12/88 all models use 150 gram
tube - green grease part no. 001 989 23 51/10 DO NOT MIX GREASE
TYPES - unexpected results may occur.<BR>
As to setting the free play, certainly the dial gauge method is
preferred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Here's how I did it ON A 107 before I
bought a dial gauge: (N/A for 126 and those w/o washer)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Re-assemble the washer and adjust nut
and tighten it about 25 to 30 Nm while spinning the wheel. Back
off the adjust nut just enough so that you can barely rotate the
washer behind it by hand - that should be as close as you can
do it by feel. Tighten the lock bolt and check that the washer
can still be rotated by hand - it should be a little stiff, but
movable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">If you replace the bearings and races,
you should repeat the above after a few hundred miles to assure
that adjustment is correct. I've always had to re-adjust after
bearing race change, so plan on doing it anytime you replace bearings
and races . . .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#cccccc">Hint: If changing bearings, put the new
bearing races in the freezer. Put the hub in the oven at about
250F. Drive out the old races while the hub is hot. After a few
hours in the freezer, the races will almost drop into the hub
without a driver - but use a wood or plastic driver to assure
proper seating of the bearing races.</FONT></P>
