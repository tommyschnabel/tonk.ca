		<p>This procedure is very important to ensure safe installation of Cruise Control Amplifiers vehicles manufactured from 1981 through Present. Even though these Amps are reasonably hardy, excessive current draw from the Amplifier Output Section can blow the power transistors, fuse circuit board traces, melt solder joints and burn the pc board! The couple minutes it takes to perform this procedure may save hours of Cruise Control System down-time, troubleshooting and, naturally, the cost of replacing blown Amplifiers. <b>This procedure does not guarantee the system will work</b> it only minimizes the possibility of blowing the Amplifier and can point to several obvious actuator malfunctions. The actuator could still be non-functional: worn traces, broken gears, etc. <b><i>Please perform even if installing a new Actuator!</i> There is a failure mode in the actuator that can cause catastrophic failure of the amplifier:</b> The motor armature can fail with opposing commutator contacts shorted; this will cause excessive current draw and melt the output section of the amplifier. (See Step 3 below.)</p>
		<p>** If in a hurry please perform at least Step 3 - it's easy and quick! **</p>

			<li>Step 3: <b>THIS IS A CRITICAL TEST</b> This is performed at the actuator plug (unplugged from the vehicle) Ignition Switch OFF<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It is usually not necessary to disconnect the throttle linkage because the solenoid will not engage. This test runs the actuator motor in both directions and checks the current draw of the armature. It should be <b><i>between</i> 120 mAdc and 180 mAdc A shorted armature can draw a couple amps and blow the output section of any amplifier.</b> Please do not plug in Amplifier if readings are out of tolerance.<br>
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Use a current-limited 13.8 Vdc Power Supply with a series DC Ammeter. Connect between pins 4 and 5 of the actuator plug. The motor should spin (audibly) and be relatively quiet, smooth and strong, current draw about 130 mA dc. It should not rattle, chug, make excessive noise or draw high current. Reverse the connections to pins 4 and 5 and test spin the other direction.<br>
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>Step 4: This is performed at the actuator plug (unplugged from the vehicle) Ignition Switch OFF<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This tests the actuator engage solenoid. Apply 13.8 Vdc to pin 7 of the actuator, common to pin 6. The solenoid should activate (audible click.)</p>
